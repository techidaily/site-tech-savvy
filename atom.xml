Prometheus, the new Bing AI-powered search engine, uses OpenAI’s language model and works differently but similarly to ChatGPT.</p><p> For every query you submit, it will scour the internet for relevant answers. But it doesn’t stop there. The search engine will further summarize its findings into more straightforward and articulate responses that you can use immediately.

It’ll return a search result box similar to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-google-featured-snippets/" >Google’s Featured Snippets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bing-ai-powered-search-results.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI-powered search showing results page"                ></li><li>It’ll also show you prompts that you can click on to learn more about your subject, including how to contact them (for most people searches).</li><li>You can further refine your search by typing a query into the chat box just beneath the main result (if available for your query).

You can also expect to get citations or references as well as conversational chat results.</p><p> In March 2023, Google also released the early version of Bard, its ChatGPT and Bing AI search competitor. Time will tell who does it better.

But where do you find the time to start?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> If you haven’t heard, you now live in a world where you can use artificial intelligence and chatbots like ChatGPT to set health goals. In this article, learn how to leverage ChatGPT for setting health goals and feel like you have a personal nutritionist.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Understanding-Your-Health-Goals"><a href="#Understanding-Your-Health-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Your Health Goals"></a>Understanding Your Health Goals</h2><p> Think of setting health goals as programming your wellness GPS. Just like you’d set a destination for a road trip, health goals give you a clear route to better health.</p><p> Health goals are your roadmap, guiding you away from habits that are bad for you (e.g., co-binging pizza and Netflix) and towards healthier daily choices. Whether it’s regular exercise, a balanced diet, or solid sleep, these goals keep you on the right path.</p><p> And just like you wouldn’t start a road trip without a destination, don’t start your wellness journey without setting your health goals. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-provide-reliable-health-information/" >ChatGPT can provide reliable health information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so there are plenty of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-consider-using-chatgpt-health-advice/" >reasons to use ChatGPT for health advice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, including setting health goals.</p><h2 id="Getting-Started-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#Getting-Started-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started With ChatGPT"></a>Getting Started With ChatGPT</h2><p> Learning <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/" >how to use ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy. You can interact with ChatGPT in a variety of ways, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask questions</strong>. If you are wondering about the health benefits of a certain food or want to understand the science behind sleep cycles, simply ask.</li><li><strong>Engage in discussions</strong>. This is where ChatGPT really starts to shine. You can ask questions and, based on the response, ask follow-up questions specific to your situation. It will provide a response tailored just for you.</li></ul><p> To get the most out of ChatGPT, you will also want to know <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/" >how to write effective ChatGPT prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Try, for example, “You are a nutritional expert and world-renowned health coach working with a new client who needs help establishing health goals” and see what kind of responses you get! You might be amazed at the conversation that follows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2023-06-17-at-10-22-29-am.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT prompt and response"                ></p><h2 id="Brainstorming-Health-Goals"><a href="#Brainstorming-Health-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Brainstorming Health Goals"></a>Brainstorming Health Goals</h2><p> So you’ve chatted with ChatGPT and now you’re ready to set some health goals. But wait, what if you’re not quite sure what your goals should be? No problem! All you need to do is ask.</p><p> For instance, you could ask, “What are some common health goals people set?” and ChatGPT would provide you with a list of typical targets.</p><p> But ChatGPT can go a step further. If you tell it about your lifestyle, habits, and current health status, it can suggest personalized goals.</p><p> Here’s an example: You could tell ChatGPT, “I sit a lot for work and often eat fast food. What are some health goals I could set?” Based on this, ChatGPT could suggest goals like taking regular breaks to stretch, incorporating more whole foods into your meals, or setting a healthier sleep schedule.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2023-06-17-at-10-24-19-am.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to a health question"                ></p><p> Remember, it’s your journey and your goals. ChatGPT is there to help you brainstorm and customize them to fit your needs.

But ChatGPT can help you anticipate potential obstacles and create strategies to overcome them.</p><p> For example, you might ask, “What are common challenges in maintaining a regular exercise routine and how can I overcome them?” In response, ChatGPT could highlight issues like lack of time, loss of motivation, or physical discomfort. And it can suggest solutions such as scheduling workouts, setting smaller, achievable targets, or trying different forms of exercise to keep things interesting.</p><p> Facing trouble with dietary changes?

While ChatGPT was a game-changer, ChatGPT Enterprise has the potential to redefine how teams and workplaces operate forever.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So what exactly does ChatGPT Enterprise offer that ChatGPT’s others models don’t?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT-Enterprise-and-What-Are-Its-Capabilities"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT-Enterprise-and-What-Are-Its-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT Enterprise, and What Are Its Capabilities?"></a>What Is ChatGPT Enterprise, and What Are Its Capabilities?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/man-holding-phone-using-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Man holding phone using ChatGPT"                ></p><p> ChatGPT Enterprise represents a major upgrade from the regular ChatGPT model that has captured the world’s interest.</p><p> While the standard ChatGPT offers a glimpse into the transformative potential of <a class="link"   href="http://makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, ChatGPT Enterprise enhances this with enterprise-specific features tailored for business use cases.</p><h3 id="Uncapped-Access-to-GPT-4"><a href="#Uncapped-Access-to-GPT-4" class="headerlink" title="Uncapped Access to GPT-4"></a>Uncapped Access to GPT-4</h3><p> One of the biggest limitations of regular ChatGPT is the usage caps in place to manage overwhelming demand (between 25 and 200 messages per three hours). ChatGPT Enterprise removes these restraints, providing unlimited conversational queries with its upgraded GPT-4 model. This allows your team to fully utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities without worrying about running into limits.</p><p> The enterprise version also delivers up to two times faster response times compared to the regular versions, enabling more dynamic back-and-forth conversations. Long input delays are eliminated, and you get answers rapidly.</p><h3 id="Increased-Context-for-Complex-Questions"><a href="#Increased-Context-for-Complex-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Increased Context for Complex Questions"></a>Increased Context for Complex Questions</h3><p> ChatGPT Enterprise expands the context window to 32,000 tokens, four times more than the regular GPT-4 model (with 8192 tokens). This enables processing significantly longer and more detailed inputs.</p><p> You can pose multifaceted questions, input large passages of text, or provide broader background information to guide ChatGPT’s responses. The expanded context results in more accurate and nuanced answers for complex business needs.</p><h3 id="Advanced-Data-Analysis"><a href="#Advanced-Data-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Advanced-Data Analysis"></a>Advanced-Data Analysis</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/four-animated-characters-analyzing-growth-charts.jpg"                      alt="Four animated characters analyzing growth charts"                ></p><p>Image Credit: <a class="link"   href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/people-analyzing-growth-charts%5F12643932.htm#query=data%20analysis&position=2&from%5Fview=search&track=ais" >Freepik <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Beyond text, ChatGPT Enterprise offers unlimited access to advanced statistical analysis abilities.

By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access availability to as many people as possible.</p></blockquote><p> Whether the introduction of the ChatGPT Plus subscription tier results in a downgraded service for free users remains to be seen, but in theory, offering high-demand users the option to move to a premium tier with better service will free up the free service for more occasional users.</p><h2 id="OpenAI-Will-Launch-Additional-Premium-ChatGPT-Options-in-the-Future"><a href="#OpenAI-Will-Launch-Additional-Premium-ChatGPT-Options-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="OpenAI Will Launch Additional Premium ChatGPT Options in the Future"></a>OpenAI Will Launch Additional Premium ChatGPT Options in the Future</h2><p> A subscription ChatGPT tier was always on the cards, and it seems OpenAI is also considering additional plans in the future.</p><blockquote><p>We are actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability</p></blockquote><p> Given the popularity of ChatGPT and the numerous ways the tool is being used and integrated into other services, it’s no wonder OpenAI is exploring every monetization avenue possible.</p><p> For now, US residents can sign up for the ChatGPT Plus waitlist for a chance to use the premium tier, while the rest of the world will have to wait patiently.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-leading-funny-image-editor-hub/"><u>[New] Leading Funny Image Editor Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-the-vanguard-of-virtual-fame-instagrams-25-luminaries-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Vanguard of Virtual Fame Instagram's 25 Luminaries for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-on-your-lenovo-thinkphone-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock on your Lenovo ThinkPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/are-user-dialogues-pivotal-for-the-progress-of-chatgpts-knowledge/"><u>Are User Dialogues Pivotal for the Progress of ChatGPT's Knowledge?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/comprehensive-instructions-to-get-and-install-arduino-nano-drivers-on-windows-machines/"><u>Comprehensive Instructions to Get & Install Arduino Nano Drivers on Windows Machines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-success-harnessing-automation-for-growth/"><u>Cookiebot-Driven Success: Harnessing Automation for Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/from-concept-to-characters-integrating-chatgpt-into-game-development/"><u>From Concept to Characters: Integrating ChatGPT Into Game Development</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/inside-the-minds-of-machines-palm-2-and-gpt-4-analysis/"><u>Inside the Minds of Machines: PaLM 2 and GPT-4 Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-meizu-21-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Meizu 21 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/the-insiders-guide-to-finesse-and-control-on-insta-stories-for-2024/"><u>The Insider's Guide to Finesse and Control on Insta Stories for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014853/22899" target="_top" id="2014853">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014853" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014853/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Here are some of the main ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Rewrite</strong>: The tool enables you to improve your writing by providing suggestions to enhance clarity, fix spelling and grammar errors, and adjust the length of the text to what you’d prefer. It also allows you to change the tone of the writing, simplify complex language, and paraphrase sentences, all of which can significantly improve your writing productivity.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/usechatgpt-rewriting.JPG"                      alt="Screenshot UseChatGPT Rewriting text"                ></li><li><strong>Summarize</strong>: If you have long text that you need to go through, this tool can offer concise summaries and key takeaways, allowing you to quickly grasp the main ideas and essential points of any text.

It enables you to seamlessly respond to emails, engage on various social media platforms and participate in conversations on messaging apps like WhatsApp and Slack. The generated responses can be of good quality but need your review before sending.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/usechatgpt-replying.JPG"                      alt="Screenshot of UseChatGPT Replying to an Email"                ></li><li><strong>Explain</strong>: Occasionally, you’ll come across complex contexts, and you need someone to give you a simpler explanation.

The most important prompts are already provided, and all you have to do is to provide context for the prompt or content that needs to be worked on.</li><li>The tool is free to use. It has an in-built AI plugin (Free AI) which can be used independently of more established tools like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-google-bard/" >ChatGPT and Bard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Also, if you have accounts in the more popular AI tools, the tool uses an API to give you instant access.</li><li>The tool’s providers have also curated a list of <a class="link"   href="https://www.usechatgpt.ai/prompts" >over 150 optimized prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can access from their website and use to improve your productivity in a wide range of activities. Whether you want to write a more optimized article than an existing one or write a YouTube video script, the prompts can give you a good head start.</li></ol><p> While UseChatGPT seems to tick all the right boxes, it’s far from perfect.</p><ol><li>The Free AI feature has a daily limit after exhausting your one week of free use. Inviting friends can get up to 24 weeks of Free AI without a daily limitation. Meanwhile, if you use the other AI providers, your usage limit depends on your account limit.</li><li>It’s currently only available on Chrome. You cannot use this tool with other browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Meanwhile, its competitors, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.copilotly.com/" >Copilotly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are available for more browsers.</li><li>It doesn’t keep a record of sessions. Unlike ChatGPT, which saves your work in chat sequences you can access later, UseChatGPT deletes your history once you close your browser.</li></ol><p> Overall, UseChatGPT is a resourceful copilot that can significantly improve your productivity at no extra cost. Considering its early stage in the development cycle, it’s likely to get way better with time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Use-the-UseChatGPT-Extension"><a href="#Should-You-Use-the-UseChatGPT-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Should You Use the UseChatGPT Extension?"></a>Should You Use the UseChatGPT Extension?</h2><p> UseChatGPT is just one of the many AI tools coming up today, courtesy of the AI race. It has a simple yet functional design that can significantly improve your ability to utilize AI technology and consequently be more productive. If you want to improve your productivity, this tool is worth a try, especially considering it’s free to use.</p><p> Meanwhile, there are many other alternative tools in the market you can consider, such as Microsoft’s Copilot.

It can summarize articles, advise on the structure and content of writing, and compose emails, to name a few.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> However, it can be clumsy when it comes to dealing with file formats like PDFs. This makes it tricky if you want it to work with content in this format. If you are struggling to get ChatGPT to read PDFs, here are some easy ways to do it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Supply-ChatGPT-With-a-URL"><a href="#1-Supply-ChatGPT-With-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="1. Supply ChatGPT With a URL"></a>1. Supply ChatGPT With a URL</h2><p> ChatGPT can reference URLs that you supply it with. This means that if the PDF file is online, getting ChatGPT to reference it is super easy. A URL is a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-key-url-elements/" >web address that comprises five key components <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We don’t need to go into detail here, all you need to know is the web address of the PDF you want to reference.</p><p> For example, say you are researching the US Constitution and need a summary of certain sections. If you find an online PDF, then getting ChatGPT to summarize it is easy. In this instance, we found a copy of the Constitution freely available on a <a class="link"   href="https://usgovernmentmanual.gov/ReadLibraryItem.ashx?SFN=HHpPD10yEeWjNpxh5LEASSgHjOH0S/X9&SF=VHhnJrOeEAnGaa/rtk/JOg==" >US Government website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Let’s say you want a summary of Article One, sections one to four. Armed with the URL of the document, you can prompt ChatGPT to summarize these sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-response-to-pdf-query-on-the-us-constitution.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of response to PDF query on the US constitution"                ></p><p> ChatGPT will then nicely summarize the main points on the requested pages. One point of note here, there are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/do-chatgpt-responses-have-character-or-word-limit/" >limitations to ChatGPT prompts and responses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially when it comes to more complex requests. So, for larger documents, it is good policy to break the task down into smaller parts.</p><h2 id="2-Copy-Text-From-the-PDF"><a href="#2-Copy-Text-From-the-PDF" class="headerlink" title="2. Copy Text From the PDF"></a>2. Copy Text From the PDF</h2><p> If you have a copy of the PDF on your computer, then the easiest way is to simply copy the text you need from the PDF. In the example below, we opened a PDF copy of a MakeUseOf article about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >prompting techniques for ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We used Microsoft Edge to open it, and then we highlighted the relevant text and copied it to the clipboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-copying-text-from-pdf-opened-in-ms-edge-1.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of copying text from PDF opened in Microsoft Edge"                ></p><p> The text can then be pasted into a ChatGPT prompt, and the desired results attained. In this case, we asked it to bullet point the main points in the text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-chatgpt-summarizing-copied-text.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT summarizing copied text"                ></p><p> As you can see, ChatGPT will easily respond to prompts with text pasted into them. Just remember not to ask too much of it in a single request. This technique will work with most applications that can open PDFs.</p><h2 id="3-Convert-the-PDF-Into-a-Text-Document"><a href="#3-Convert-the-PDF-Into-a-Text-Document" class="headerlink" title="3. Convert the PDF Into a Text Document"></a>3. Convert the PDF Into a Text Document</h2><p> ChatGPT will happily read text, after all, the beating heart of any AI chatbot is a large language model (LLM). <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >LLMs are huge text databases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that AI chatbots reference to supply human-like responses. Although PDFs contain text, they aren’t easy to edit. This makes it awkward if you want to work with this format in ChatGPT. But converting it to a more manageable format is easy.</p><p> There are numerous ways to do this, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/convert-pdf-to-word-google-drive/" >converting it into a Word document using Google Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There are also <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/free-online-pdf-editors-secure-private/" >plenty of online PDF editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, many of which will let you convert PDFs to text.</p><p> However, if you have Microsoft Word or a similar word processor installed, then you can simply open the file and save it as a text or word document. To demonstrate this, we will use the same article as we used in method two. The following steps walk you through the process of doing this in Word:</p><ol><li>Open Word and use the <strong>Open</strong> command and browse to the folder where the document is stored.</li><li>If the document does not appear, use the file type dropdown box and select <strong>PDF Files</strong> from the options.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-word-opening-pdf-file.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Word opening PDF file"                ></li><li>When you open the file you will be asked to convert the document, press <strong>OK</strong> to proceed.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-word-pdf-conversion.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Word PDF Conversion"                ></li><li>Word will now convert and open the file, you can use the <strong>Save As</strong> command to save it as a Word or text document as preferred.</li></ol><p> Once the conversion is complete, you can copy the text directly into ChatGPT and run prompts on it to get your desired results.</p><h2 id="4-Install-and-Use-an-Extension"><a href="#4-Install-and-Use-an-Extension" class="headerlink" title="4. Install and Use an Extension"></a>4.

Sure, you can copy the text from a PDF or convert it into a text document, but is there a simpler way to go about it? Luckily, there is. One of the easiest ways to get ChatGPT to read PDFs is to just install and use an extension.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-file-uploader-ext/becfinhbfclcgokjlobojlnldbfillpf/related" >ChatGPT File Uploader <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free-to-install Chrome Extension that allows you to upload any file, including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, image files, and, of course, PDFs. What makes this an excellent method is just how easy it is to use.</p><p> The steps are straightforward—install the ChatGPT File Uploader to your browser, open ChatGPT, and you’ll notice a shiny, new <strong>Upload</strong> button next to the message bar at the bottom. From there, all you have to do is hit the button and choose the PDF you want to upload.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="PDFs-Don’t-Have-to-Hinder-Your-ChatGPT-Usage"><a href="#PDFs-Don’t-Have-to-Hinder-Your-ChatGPT-Usage" class="headerlink" title="PDFs Don’t Have to Hinder Your ChatGPT Usage"></a>PDFs Don’t Have to Hinder Your ChatGPT Usage</h2><p> ChatGPT is a versatile tool that can handle various text-based tasks with ease. However, when it comes to working with PDFs, it can be challenging. Thankfully, there are four easy ways to work around this obstacle.</p><p> These methods overcome ChatGPT’s limitations with PDFs, allowing it to be even more useful in various text-based tasks. The quickest method is to simply copy the text from a PDF, but just occasionally this can be problematic. Make sure you’re clued in with fixes in case you run into issues.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> However, it can be clumsy when it comes to dealing with file formats like PDFs.

While previously out of reach, tasks such as creating high-quality art and composing web apps are now possible. Many jobs that were formerly unattainable by computers are suddenly at risk of automation.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> With advancements increasing at an alarming rate, it’s easy to worry that your job may be at risk of automation. Despite the surprising abilities AI programs like ChatGPT have already shown, there are still places where humans can outshine them. Here are three things you can do using Excel that are still out of reach for ChatGPT.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Using-Excel-for-Long-Term-Report-Storage-and-Data-Entry"><a href="#1-Using-Excel-for-Long-Term-Report-Storage-and-Data-Entry" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Excel for Long-Term Report Storage and Data Entry"></a>1. Using Excel for Long-Term Report Storage and Data Entry</h2><p> There’s hope in a few common tasks for those worried that AI may be coming for their job. Gaining extra competence in Excel’s VBA and the wide world of automated analysis tools can give you a leg up in the job market.</p><p> ChatGPT can generate and analyze a variety of data and general reporting information. One thing that it still hasn’t mastered, however, is storing that information for more than one session. That means that getting the most out of an ever-evolving data set still requires a human to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-custom-formatting-excel/" >format and sanitize data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Despite the doubtlessly accurate inferences AI might be able to make given a set of data, re-entering that information with each session is still incredibly time-consuming and problematic. This means there’s still a place for making highly-formatted sanitized reports, performing required maintenance, and storing the data for long-term use.</p><p> It also means that despite ChatGPT’s best efforts, unless they build in a customer interface that is specifically designed for multi-session uses, a human will always be required to re-upload relevant data.</p><p> In addition to simple storage and data entry, there’s always an open market available for recurring automated analysis that is beyond the current capability of ChatGPT. While using ChatGPT to analyze sales trends is useful, getting an alert informing you of a massive market shift is far handier.</p><p> Many companies offer specialized services that enable you to connect your Excel-generated sales data via an API to monitor data in real time. Doing so saves time manually entering data into AI chatbots like ChatGPT. It also totally eliminates the need for such cumbersome analysis altogether, while still maintaining human-necessary jobs.</p><p> While building out a single report can be handy, useful trends are more visible over long periods of time. Building dashboards to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-scatter-plot-predict-data-behavior-microsoft-excel/" >visualize data trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and raise red flags immediately when things go wrong is still a highly valuable skill.</p><h2 id="2-Customizable-Report-Creation-in-Excel"><a href="#2-Customizable-Report-Creation-in-Excel" class="headerlink" title="2. Customizable Report Creation in Excel"></a>2. Customizable Report Creation in Excel</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/data-dashboard.jpg"                      alt="A laptop sitting on a desk showing a data dashboard. There are several graphs showing and some other various data on screen."                ></p><p> While a single report is simple to create with ChatGPT, a set of data frozen in time isn’t always beneficial. One of the most potent abilities that Excel gives us the ability to create reports that the reader can instantly customize.</p><p> Rather than taking the time to create a separate expense report for each department in your company, you can use Excel to create a single customized company-wide report. Adding a dropdown that filters data by the value in a single column is fast and straightforward to do.</p><p> It can make a basic expense report able to be used multiple times across an entire organization. Doing so saves you from making single-use reports only focused on one time period within a single department. This allows users to filter information based on the work they are currently doing.</p><p> Adding in a few controls can make a more complex and nuanced experience for the person reading your report. Consider customizing time frames, adding limits to remove outliers, or calculating custom data in your reports.</p><p> Data-driven dashboards are almost always a valuable addition to reporting systems storing large quantities of info. If you’re capable of creating a dashboard that can easily handle large volumes of data, you’re likely to always remain gainfully employed. Take the time to learn how to use some of Excel’s more esoteric functions to ensure your readers can tailor your reports to their departmental needs.</p><p> Make your reports more useful by adding some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/essential-excel-functions/" >simple Excel features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Ensure your reports can pull variable timeframes, highlight potential problems automatically, and sanitize data for long-term storage and flexibility.</p><h2 id="3-Easy-to-Use-Forms-in-Excel"><a href="#3-Easy-to-Use-Forms-in-Excel" class="headerlink" title="3. Easy-to-Use Forms in Excel"></a>3. Easy-to-Use Forms in Excel</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pexels-kampus-production-8353777.jpg"                      alt="Man in black suit sitting in front of a computer"                ></p><p> Forms are another great Excel option for those looking for value that ChatGPT can’t provide. Entering information manually can be time-consuming and frustrating. Giving end users the option to enter data independently as it arises frees up time and energy better spent analyzing the results.</p><p> AI programs may be able to tell you how to populate all the items in a form, but making it user-friendly is another story. Creating a simple-to-use spreadsheet that analyzes the data that it’s given is a much more streamlined process than having the end user give you the data, only for you to then give it to an AI tool to analyze.</p><p> Pairing a little bit of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/unlock-hidden-developer-tab-excel/" >basic VBA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Excel’s extensive list of controls allows for creating surprisingly complex forms. Linking different spreadsheets with forms is a straightforward yet valuable skill to master. ChatGPT may be capable of interpreting data, but giving your users a secure way to enter data is still beyond its reach.</p><p> For those looking to blend forms and long-term data storage, looking into different ways to export data from Excel is essential. Learning how to take data from an entry form to a SQL database can help insulate your job and keep your work essential.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983472">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983472%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983472/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Isn’t-Going-to-Automate-You-Out-of-a-Job-Yet"><a href="#ChatGPT-Isn’t-Going-to-Automate-You-Out-of-a-Job-Yet" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Isn’t Going to Automate You Out of a Job Yet"></a>ChatGPT Isn’t Going to Automate You Out of a Job Yet</h2><p> Excel has many tasks that are still beyond the range of ChatGPT and its cohort of machine learning-driven knockoffs.

So, why bother crafting your prompt in AIPRM rather than using it directly in ChatGPT? This can be useful when you need to reuse the prompt for a similar task in the future.</p><p> To create a custom AIPRM prompt:</p><p> First, click the <strong>Own</strong> tab on the main page. Next, click <strong>Add Private Prompt</strong>, and a new prompt template will appear.</p><p> Next, fill out all the details of your prompt. Note that providing more detailed information in the <strong>Prompt Template</strong> field will increase your prompt’s value and the response quality from ChatGPT. Let’s say you wish to create a prompt to promote your business on Facebook. You can provide specific details like the name of your business, your services, your target audience, hashtags to use, and the tone of voice. In the same field, create the task by writing the instructions that ChatGPT will follow to generate the desired text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/create-aiprm-prompt-template.jpeg"                      alt="AIPRM screenshot showing how to create a template"                ></p><p> For instance, “Write a Facebook post with emojis and a call to action about <strong>[PROMPT]</strong>.” Make sure to add the prompt variable <strong>[PROMPT]</strong> in your template, as it will be replaced by what you type whenever you use this prompt. In this example, the prompt variable <strong>[PROMPT]</strong> will be the topic for the Facebook post. You can also provide one or more examples of what you want the output to look like.</p><p> Next, fill in the <strong>Teaser</strong> field. This is a description to help you remember the prompt easily. The <strong>Prompt Hint</strong> reminds you of what you will type in when using the prompt. This replaces the prompt variable <strong>[PROMPT]</strong>.</p><p> Now, choose a <strong>Title</strong> for your prompt. This can be anything that will help you remember the purpose of the prompt.</p><p> Lastly, select the <strong>Topic</strong>, <strong>Activity</strong>, <strong>Who can see this?</strong> and <strong>Made for</strong> (the ChatGPT model). Write your <strong>Author Name</strong> and <strong>Author URL</strong>. Click <strong>Save Prompt</strong> to finalize the creation of your prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aiprm-prompt-template-creation.jpeg"                      alt="AIPRM for ChatGPT prompt template creation page"                ></p><p> Once your prompt is saved, you can find it under the <strong>Own</strong> tab.</p><p> You have just created your first AIPRM prompt! Test it out and see what kind of response you get from ChatGPT. You can always edit your prompt by clicking the <strong>pencil</strong> icon next to it.</p><p> AIPRM for ChatGPT is a handy productivity tool that can help you get relevant and quality responses from ChatGPT. Its vast library of expertly crafted prompts makes it easier to interact with ChatGPT and get the desired output.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Master-the-Art-of-Conversation-Overlooked-Strengths-in-AI-Tools"><a href="#Master-the-Art-of-Conversation-Overlooked-Strengths-in-AI-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Master the Art of Conversation: Overlooked Strengths in AI Tools"></a>Master the Art of Conversation: Overlooked Strengths in AI Tools</h2><p> ChatGPT is packed with features—more than most folks realize. This means most of us aren’t using the full range of ChatGPT’s features and could be getting more out of the world’s leading AI chatbot.</p><p><strong>MAKEUSEOF VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So, here are five ChatGPT features you’re not using but absolutely should be.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Read-Aloud"><a href="#1-Read-Aloud" class="headerlink" title="1  Read Aloud"></a>1  Read Aloud</h2><p> In March 2024, OpenAI launched ChatGPT’s Read Aloud feature, enabling the AI tool to read its responses to you. It can be handy if you’re working on a long piece of text and want to hear how it sounds spoken, but it also means that you can now effectively converse with ChatGPT (using ChatGPT’s voice input feature).</p><p> ChatGPT’s Read Aloud option is found underneath each response it creates.</p><ul><li>On the web, scroll to the bottom of the response, and you’ll find the Read Aloud button.</li><li>On Android or iOS, tap and hold the message until the context menu appears, then select Read Aloud.</li></ul><p> Furthermore, Read Aloud can speak in 37 different languages but will also try to auto-detect whatever language it’s reading.</p><h2 id="2-Personalized-Responses"><a href="#2-Personalized-Responses" class="headerlink" title="2  Personalized Responses"></a>2  Personalized Responses</h2><p> ChatGPT’s Custom Instructions give you greater control over how the AI chatbot responds to your inputs. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-ways-to-use-chatgpt-custom-instructions/" >ChatGPT’s custom instructions can range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from in-depth information about your life, business, or otherwise, to simple instructions, such as making sure it only uses imperial measurements or always responds with your name.</p><p> But it doesn’t stop there. If you use ChatGPT to fulfill a specific role each day, you could add a specific set of custom instructions that match your expectations. For example:</p><ul><li>Always act as an expert in your field</li><li>Break down complex ideas into simple explanations with clear reasoning</li><li>Always provide sources for your claims</li><li>Refer to &lt;<a class="link"   href="http://www.examplewebsite.com/examplepage%3E" >www.examplewebsite.com/examplepage&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for specific information when requested</li><li>Always take a deep breath and think before answering questions and requests</li></ul><p> That’s a small example, but illustrates how you might shape ChatGPT’s output towards your daily use, saving you time each day.</p><h2 id="3-ChatGPT-Memory-and-Temporary-Chat"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Memory-and-Temporary-Chat" class="headerlink" title="3  ChatGPT Memory and Temporary Chat"></a>3  ChatGPT Memory and Temporary Chat</h2><p> ChatGPT Memory and Temporary Chat are two features launching together, aimed to give ChatGPT better recall—and a way to avoid that recall altogether.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq" >ChatGPT’s Memory <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to set specific information it should always remember about you. But that’s not all. Over time, its memory can improve, learn details about you to add to its memory, and deliver improved accuracy and performance based upon this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/openai-chatgpt-memory-options-and-management-panel.png"                      alt="openai chatgpt memory options and management panel"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Part of ChatGPT’s Memory is the supposition you’re talking to it about anything and everything. It gives an example of “You mention that you have a toddler and that she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat.” That’s cute, no doubt, but it’s not the sort of information most folks are providing to ChatGPT regularly (at least, I assume not).</p><p> But once those memories begin to stack up, you can also ask it to forget specific bits of information, removing data, personal information, and so on. You can also delete the entire ChatGPT memory, resetting it back to zero.</p><p> At the time of writing, ChatGPT Memory is only available to a small number of users, but the wider roll-out of this long-expected feature is due in 2024.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120861/26400?prodsku=Saturn" target="_top" id="2120861">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120861" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120861/26400?prodsku=Saturn"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Temporary-Chat"><a href="#Temporary-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Temporary Chat"></a>Temporary Chat</h3><p> Now, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT’s Memory feature, many were worried about the additional privacy implications. ChatGPT already uses a lot of data to continually train its models, and with the addition of memory, some were worried there would be no way to converse with ChatGPT privately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chatgpt-temporary-chat-option.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt temporary chat option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/blog/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In response, OpenAI revealed ideas for <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq" >Temporary Chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a mode that enables “a conversation with a blank slate.” In Temporary Chat mode, ChatGPT won’t be aware of any previous conversations or memory, but would still use your custom instructions if set. It’s a little like Incognito or Private mode in a browser.</p><p> Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Temporary Chat mode is only available to a small number of users, limiting the amount of people using it. However, when it arrives, it’ll be a useful tool for those moments you want to ask ChatGPT a question but don’t want it linked to your profile forever more.</p><h2 id="4-Free-Trial-Invites"><a href="#4-Free-Trial-Invites" class="headerlink" title="4  Free Trial Invites"></a>4  Free Trial Invites</h2><p> Want to share ChatGPT Plus with your buddies, but they don’t have the cash for the subscription? Well, you can use a ChatGPT Plus free trial invite to grant them a 14-day free ChatGPT Plus experience, with access to every feature.</p><p> The only real downside to the ChatGPT Plus free trial is that anyone taking it has to sign up for an account using a credit or debit card—which means the card will be charged straight away when the trial ends.</p><h2 id="5-Shared-Links"><a href="#5-Shared-Links" class="headerlink" title="5  Shared Links"></a>5  Shared Links</h2><p> If the person you invite to trial ChatGPT is put off by the credit card sign-up, you could share your ChatGPT conversation with them instead. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-chatgpt-shared-links-how-do-they-work/" >ChatGPT’s shared links launched in May 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and offer a way for ChatGPT users to share conversations outside the confines of the web interface or the smartphone app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chatgpt-shared-links-with-share-name-option.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt shared links with share name option"                ></p><p> Anyone with the link can view the ChatGPT conversation. Those with a ChatGPT account can continue the conversation, taking over from you (making it a somewhat collaborative process). Those without an account can just scroll through and see what transpired between you and the AI chatbot.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So, here are five ChatGPT features you’re not using but absolutely should be.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-futures-finest-the-leading-photo-frame-tools-24/"><u>[New] Future's Finest The Leading Photo Frame Tools '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/affordable-gopro-purchase-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-2024/"><u>Affordable GoPro Purchase Guide Tips & Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/create-meme-on-giphy-for-2024/"><u>Create Meme on Giphy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/exploring-claude-2-its-purpose-and-uses/"><u>Exploring Claude 2: Its Purpose and Uses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/from-manuscript-to-machine-has-chatgpt-redefined-academic-writing/"><u>From Manuscript to Machine: Has ChatGPT Redefined Academic Writing?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-changeadd-location-filters-on-snapchat-for-your-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change/Add Location Filters on Snapchat For your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-find-ispoofer-pro-activation-key-on-vivo-s17-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Find iSpoofer Pro Activation Key On Vivo S17 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-or-downgrade-apple-iphone-6s-without-losing-anything-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Update or Downgrade Apple iPhone 6s Without Losing Anything? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-htc-u23-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My HTC U23 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-screen-grabber-chromebook-edition-leader/"><u>In 2024, Premier Screen Grabber Chromebook Edition Leader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/social-skills-in-ai-interactions-politeness-for-gpt-users/"><u>Social Skills in AI Interactions: Politeness for GPT Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/surpassing-the-maximum-character-allowance-in-gpt/"><u>Surpassing The Maximum Character Allowance in GPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/the-flawed-logic-of-ai-based-medical-advice/"><u>The Flawed Logic of AI-Based Medical Advice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/1722853500401-troubleshooting-tips-for-when-netflix-titles-dont-stream-properly/"><u>Troubleshooting Tips for When Netflix Titles Don't Stream Properly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/writing-engaging-youtube-scripts-with-chatgpt-help/"><u>Writing Engaging YouTube Scripts with ChatGPT Help</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

VS Code features the ChatGPT extension to bring you an OpenAI-enabled coding environment.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> You can leverage ChatGPT’s vast coding model to complete your projects more efficiently and quicker—right inside the IDE.

Unlike GitHub Copilot, these are not officially directly from OpenAI.</p><p> Most VS Code ChatGPT extensions sampled work the same way, though. But we’ll stick to <a class="link"   href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EasyCodeAI.chatgpt-gpt4-gpt3-vscode" >EasyCode’s ChatGPT extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this article, as it’s pretty decent for demonstrating ChatGPT use cases in VS Code. It supports GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, has a free tier, and doesn’t require an API key.</p><p> To install the ChatGPT extension in VS Code:</p><ol><li>Open VS Code and click the settings icon at the bottom left of the left sidebar.</li><li>Go to <strong>Extensions</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vs-code-extensions-option.jpg"                      alt="VS Code extensions option"                ></li><li>Alternatively, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + X</strong> (<strong>Command + Shift + X</strong> for Mac) to directly open the extensions’ marketplace.</li><li>Type “ChatGPT - EasyCode” in the search bar at the top-left.</li><li>Click the extension when seen.</li><li>Finally, click <strong>Install</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-extension-marketplace.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT extension marketplace"                ></li><li>You’ll see the extension icon in the left sidebar once installed.</li><li>Click the extension icon.

Refactor and Modify Code"></a>1. Refactor and Modify Code</h2><p> ChatGPT has proven helpful for modifying procedural, functional, and object-oriented code.</p><p> For example, using this extension, we asked ChatGPT to refactor the faulty code below, a Python function to create an arbitrary dictionary and add “Buy” to each value.</p><p>&#96;def makeDict(n: str, **kwargs)-&gt;dict:<br>    some : dict<br>    for key, value in kwargs.items():<br>        some &#x3D; n+” “+value<br>    return some  </p><p>newDict &#x3D; makeDict(“Buy”, item1&#x3D;”GPT Book”, item2&#x3D;”Java Tutorial”, item3&#x3D;”Hiking Guide”)<br>&#96;</p><p> It did pretty well producing the correct code that gives the expected output, with detailed reasons for the modification:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/refactored-code-correction-example-3.jpg"                      alt="Refactored code correction example"                ></p><p> Further, you can use the <strong>Ask a followup</strong> box to tell ChtGPT to convert the code into a class and show how to instantiate it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/follow-up-box-refactor-1.jpg"                      alt="Follow up box refactored into a class"                ></p><p> The generated code above is more modular and reusable.</p><h2 id="2-Debug-Your-Code"><a href="#2-Debug-Your-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. Debug Your Code"></a>2. Debug Your Code</h2><p> If your code throws an error or doesn’t work as it should, asking ChatGPT to debug it directly inside VS Code saves time.</p><p> Although there’s no built-in prompt for debugging, you can use the <strong>Ask GPT</strong> option to create a custom prompt to debug your code.</p><p> We asked the ChatGPT extension to debug the code we used earlier. Not only did it debug. It explained it and generated the correct one, including its expected output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/debugged-code-output-1.jpg"                      alt="Debugged code output"                ></p><h2 id="3-Write-Your-Code-in-Another-Language"><a href="#3-Write-Your-Code-in-Another-Language" class="headerlink" title="3. Write Your Code in Another Language"></a>3. Write Your Code in Another Language</h2><p> You might want to write a program in a particular language besides your core. You can write your code in your core language and ask ChatGPT to rewrite it in the chosen programming language.</p><p> However, the generated code might require little human input, as ChatGPT might fail to provide a fully working converted code in some instances.</p><p> For instance, we converted the following Python code into its C equivalent using VS Code ChatGPT extension:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/code-to-tp-convert-to-c-example.jpeg"                      alt="Code to to convert to C example"                ></p><p> You can achieve this by right-clicking on the highlighted code and selecting the <strong>Ask GPT</strong> option.</p><p> Here’s our prompt in VS Code:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vs-code-chatgpt-code-convert-prompt.jpg"                      alt="VS Code chatGPT code convert prompt"                ></p><p> Although it generated the C equivalent twice before getting it right, the final code works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/generated-c-code.jpg"                      alt="Generated C code"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135349/19272" target="_top" id="2135349">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135349" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135349/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Generate-a-Frontend-Component-for-Your-API"><a href="#4-Generate-a-Frontend-Component-for-Your-API" class="headerlink" title="4. Generate a Frontend Component for Your API"></a>4. Generate a Frontend Component for Your API</h2><p> If you’ve written an API with different endpoints, you can ask the ChatGPT extension to provide a frontend component to consume it using a particular framework. This could be React, Vue, or Angular.</p><p> For instance, we used the extension to generate a React component for creating a meeting schedule based on an API endpoint created using Python’s FastAPI:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-extension-component-prompt-1.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT extension component prompt"                ></p><p> As done above, you might want to check the <strong>Ask Codebase</strong> box if you’re dealing with a large code base.</p><p> After referencing our code base, the VS Code ChatGPT extension provided a handy React component to use the provided endpoint:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/generated-react-component.jpg"                      alt="Generated react component"                ></p><h2 id="5-Explain-Code-Blocks"><a href="#5-Explain-Code-Blocks" class="headerlink" title="5. Explain Code Blocks"></a>5. Explain Code Blocks</h2><p> Assume you grabbed a piece of code from Stack Overflow or a GitHub repository. You can ask the ChatGPT extension in VS Code to explain how it works for better comprehension. This helps you debug such code easily if bugs arise due to future code changes.</p><p> In this example use case, we asked the ChatGPT extension to explain the following code; a Python class for verifying users’ email addresses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/code-to-to-explain-example.jpeg"                      alt="Code to to explain example"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137222/26400" target="_top" id="2137222">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137222" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137222/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> It generated the following response:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/code-explained-example-output.jpg"                      alt="Code explained example output"                ></p><h2 id="6-Generate-HTML-Templates-for-Your-Application"><a href="#6-Generate-HTML-Templates-for-Your-Application" class="headerlink" title="6. Generate HTML Templates for Your Application"></a>6. Generate HTML Templates for Your Application</h2><p> Using the ChatGPT extension in VS Code, you can create an HTML template (like input fields) from scratch—using the extension chat box directly. For instance, you can tell it to create an HTML template for user registration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-registration-template-example.jpg"                      alt="User registration template example"                ></p><p> But what if you’re writing an application that renders data into HTML directly (a non-SPA) and wants a project-specific template? You can use the ChatGPT extension in VS Code to create HTML templates that display the backend data to users.</p><p> For instance, if you’re using an <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/django-mvt-architecture/" >MVT architecture-based framework like Django <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can use the extension to forge HTML templates for your Django views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/generated-hmtl-template-example.jpg"                      alt="Generated HMTL template example"                ></p><p> Again, for this type of use case, you might want to click the <strong>Ask Codebase</strong> checkbox for ChatGPT to access your code base.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134503/19576" target="_top" id="2134503">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134503" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134503/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Unit-Test-Your-Code"><a href="#7-Unit-Test-Your-Code" class="headerlink" title="7. Unit-Test Your Code"></a>7. Unit-Test Your Code</h2><p> As essential as unit testing is, it can be a time consumer. You can leverage the VS Code ChatGPT extension to generate unit tests for your code and save valuable development time.</p><p> Although the ChatGPT extension has a built-in prompt for generating unit tests, you might want to write a custom prompt using the <strong>Ask Codebase</strong> option for specificity and a better result.</p><p> We asked ChatGPT to write a unit test for a registration endpoint created using Python’s FastAPI:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/unit-test-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Unit test prompt"                ></p><p> It sampled the code base efficiently to generate the required unit test:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/generated-unit-tests.jpg"                      alt="Generated unit tests"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Find-Potential-Security-Vulnerabilities"><a href="#8-Find-Potential-Security-Vulnerabilities" class="headerlink" title="8.

They’ve come a long way from producing incoherent texts. Nowadays, even free platforms can generate a logical, grammatically correct 1,000-word article on any given topic within seconds.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Although convenient, chatbots and writing tools aren’t perfect. We’ve listed the top reasons why blindly relying on them compromises the quality of your articles and diminishes your credibility.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-AI-Doesn’t-Fact-Check-Information"><a href="#1-AI-Doesn’t-Fact-Check-Information" class="headerlink" title="1. AI Doesn’t Fact-Check Information"></a>1. AI Doesn’t Fact-Check Information</h2><p> AI systems cover a broad range of general questions. They’ll scour billions of online resources to provide a condensed answer comprising the most widely accepted facts. Users often get reliable responses in science, math, and history.</p><p> Although chatbots and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-writing-tools/" >writing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> consistently strive for accuracy, they don’t double-check the facts. AI only relays what it finds. Even sophisticated systems inaccurately respond to questions about recent research ideas, advanced mathematical equations, medicine, controversial topics, and current events.</p><p> You can still <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-chatgpt-search-engine-threat/" >use ChatGPT like a search engine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just make sure you don’t take its answers at face value; otherwise, you might publish misleading information. As a general rule, always compare AI responses with official resources.</p><h2 id="2-Language-Models-Like-GPT-3-Follow-Templates"><a href="#2-Language-Models-Like-GPT-3-Follow-Templates" class="headerlink" title="2. Language Models Like GPT-3 Follow Templates"></a>2. Language Models Like GPT-3 Follow Templates</h2><p> Modern AI platforms use <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gpt-3-and-is-it-really-the-future-of-creative-work/" >sophisticated language models like GPT-3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. They execute aggressive machine and deep learning methods to produce human-like text.</p><p> Admittedly, distinguishing between GPT-3 and man-made content is challenging. Depending on your prompts, you can generate a grammatically correct, natural-sounding 1,000-word article within seconds. Most readers won’t notice anything unusual at a glance.</p><p> Despite their advancements, AI language models still follow templates. AI answers in a formulaic, repetitive manner—which might sound unnatural to trained writers. The text becomes predictable.</p><p> Take the below text about cats as an example. You won’t spot any basic errors like typos, missing punctuation marks, or misspelled words. It’s a relatively decent piece.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-article-on-cats.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Generated a 200-Word Article on Cats"                ></p><p> Now, compare it with the below photo. You’ll notice that the response follows the exact template, although this one talks about dogs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-article-about-dogs.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Generated a 200-Word Article on Dogs"                ></p><h2 id="3-Overdependence-on-AI-Makes-You-a-Lazy-Researcher"><a href="#3-Overdependence-on-AI-Makes-You-a-Lazy-Researcher" class="headerlink" title="3. Overdependence on AI Makes You a Lazy Researcher"></a>3. Overdependence on AI Makes You a Lazy Researcher</h2><p> AI has further simplified “research.” Instead of combing through Google search results, you can just ask chatbots and writing tools. They’ll provide brief, concise answers.</p><p> While innovative and convenient, this technology makes people lazy. If you constantly yearn for instant gratification, you’ll eventually neglect challenging yet critical tasks, e.g., fact-checking, data analysis, and topic research.</p><p> Before writing, make sure you study your subject. Extensive research is the core of every well-written piece—spend at least 30 to 60 minutes reading online sources. You can provide value by comparing resources, laying down verified facts, and asserting well-founded conclusions. Simply paraphrasing what chatbots say is senseless.</p><h2 id="4-AI-Scrapes-Commonly-Published-Information"><a href="#4-AI-Scrapes-Commonly-Published-Information" class="headerlink" title="4.

AI Scrapes Commonly Published Information</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/copy-ai-article-on-dogs.jpg"                      alt="Copy.ai Generates an Article on Taking Care of Dogs"                ></p><p> AI avoids inaccuracies by generating generic responses. Take the above piece as an example. When we asked an AI writing tool to talk about dog care, it focused on super-common tips, which readers have likely seen multiple times. The below photo also shows that its insights came from an unreliable source.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/copy-ai-article-sources.jpg"                      alt="Copy.ai Lists Down Article Sources"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135409/19272" target="_top" id="2135409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135409/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Generic pieces rarely gain traffic. To attract readers and score higher SERP rankings, write original articles that are exclusive to your site. Stop rewriting stuff that everyone already knows.</p><p> Of course, you can still discuss general subjects. Just make sure you cover a unique angle or stand that aligns with your branding and image.</p><h2 id="5-AI-Generates-the-Same-Results-for-Similar-Questions"><a href="#5-AI-Generates-the-Same-Results-for-Similar-Questions" class="headerlink" title="5. AI Generates the Same Results for Similar Questions"></a>5. AI Generates the Same Results for Similar Questions</h2><p> While AI scans billions of resources, its answers contain the same information. Chatbots and writing tools generate formulaic text comprising repeated data, regardless of how you state questions.

For instance, the above photo shows that ChatGPT could form professional and casual variations of the same topic. Generally, if you insert specific keywords into your prompts, you’ll trigger detailed changes.</p><p> Despite their advancements in mimicking human-like text, chatbots and writing tools still have limitations. They can’t wholly replicate tone. AI follows predetermined, formulaic templates, even when instructed to adopt a specific tone.</p><p> It’s best to curate articles yourself. Remember that consistent branding plays a crucial role in retaining site visitors. The content you publish, your layout, and the conclusions you assert should resonate with your target audience. Give them reasons to come back to your site.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115949/19272" target="_top" id="2115949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Writing-Tools-Don’t-Incorporate-SEO-Tactics-Into-Its-Pieces"><a href="#7-Writing-Tools-Don’t-Incorporate-SEO-Tactics-Into-Its-Pieces" class="headerlink" title="7. Writing Tools Don’t Incorporate SEO Tactics Into Its Pieces"></a>7. Writing Tools Don’t Incorporate SEO Tactics Into Its Pieces</h2><p> Writers typically use AI platforms to hasten the writing process. Most tools produce thousands of words within seconds, so theoretically, you could edit and publish a new blog in under 10 minutes.</p><p> Although fast, AI sacrifices quality. AI-generated pieces rarely meet the criteria to rank on SERPs—only <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/increase-visibility-website-seo-course/" >high-quality content improves site visibility <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Publishing hundreds of articles won’t matter if no one reads them.</p><p> If you want top-ranking pages, focus on providing value. Haphazardly instructing writing tools and chatbots to stuff keywords into lengthy, generic blogs yields negligible results. Search engines might even qualify your site as spam.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123726/7443" target="_top" id="2123726">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123726" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123726/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Many-Premium-Plagiarism-Checkers-Flag-AI-Generated-Pieces"><a href="#8-Many-Premium-Plagiarism-Checkers-Flag-AI-Generated-Pieces" class="headerlink" title="8.

Before producing an appropriate response, it runs relevant data from billions of resources through its language model. You can’t trace AI pieces back to a single source.</p><p> With that said, they’re still unoriginal. Chatbots and writing tools only escape plagiarism technicalities through formulaic paraphrasing. Spinning bypasses many plagiarism detectors, after all.</p><p> Writers have differing opinions about the morality of publishing AI content and plagiarism, but as a respectable professional, you should do your own research. Never risk plagiarizing content. Study the topics for yourself, draw logical conclusions, then convey them in your own words.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-AI-Chatbots-Responsibly"><a href="#Use-AI-Chatbots-Responsibly" class="headerlink" title="Use AI Chatbots Responsibly"></a>Use AI Chatbots Responsibly</h2><p> Treat AI like a tool, not a content production department. Always remember that writing tools check for neither plagiarism nor factual accuracy. Publishing AI-generated pieces as is will plummet your site’s SERP ranking, hurt your credibility, and diminish your writing quality. It’s also hard to shake off the reputation of being a lazy, AI-dependent writer.</p><p> With that said, writers don’t have to avoid AI altogether. Despite its shortcomings, it presents innovative features that will streamline your workflow and automate tedious tasks. Explore ways of responsibly utilizing it. For instance, AI could assist with non-writing activities like plagiarism detection, basic editing, keyword research, and site-building.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Although convenient, chatbots and writing tools aren’t perfect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unlocking-ChatGPT-Potential-Today"><a href="#Unlocking-ChatGPT-Potential-Today" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking ChatGPT Potential Today"></a>Unlocking ChatGPT Potential Today</h2><p> Initially released in November 2022, ChatGPT gave many of us an intriguing glimpse into what a future with AI might look like. Perhaps one where we don’t need to fret over how to write an email to our boss or can call on an AI personal assistant to explain difficult concepts quickly and simply.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Besides being able to compose a work email, ChatGPT can give you feedback on your presentation, suggest an itinerary for a weekend away, or brainstorm new ideas when you’re out of mental energy. With ChatGPT, you type your request and hit enter to see a response appear before you in a matter of seconds.</p><p> Want to learn how to use ChatGPT? We’ve got you covered.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT?"></a>What Is ChatGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/home-page-of-chatgpt-website-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="Home page of ChatGPT website october 2023"                ></p><p> ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot that can answer almost any question you have—just as if Google were a person you could have a casual conversation with.</p><p> ChatGPT is special because it doesn’t feel like you’re talking to a computer. It can converse in natural language and remember things you’ve asked before, and in the first of its kind, it can understand voice and images too. If you took a picture of the contents inside your refrigerator, for example, it could suggest something you might want to cook for dinner based on the ingredients you have.</p><p> Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT was trained on an enormous amount of data from the internet, which probably included troves of information from places like Wikipedia, blogs, how-to websites, and scientific articles. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-chatgpt-accessing-up-to-date-information-means/" >ChatGPT can now browse the web <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adding more power to an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Works"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Works" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Works"></a>How ChatGPT Works</h2><p> ChatGPT was trained using a mix of machine learning and human intervention, using a method called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p><p> In fact, the first stage of training involved humans playing the role of both a human user and an AI assistant having a conversation. This helped demonstrate responses that humans prefer and go towards building a large dataset to feed the model.</p><p> Next, a reward model needed to be created for reinforcement learning. To do this, human AI trainers once again stepped in, but this time, they were asked to rank several model answers by quality, further helping ChatGPT choose the best response.</p><p> All of this is to say humans had a hand in helping to train ChatGPT to achieve a higher level of accuracy in its answers, but also to make sure that it sounded natural to talk to.</p><p> Far from being perfect, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >there are many problems facing ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, from confidently stating wrong facts to being a weapon for disinformation. Make sure to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/protect-privacy-using-chatgpt-for-work/" >protect your privacy when using ChatGPT for work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and never include personal information.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-ChatGPT-Account"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-ChatGPT-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a ChatGPT Account"></a>How to Create a ChatGPT Account</h2><p> To access ChatGPT, you will need to create an account on the <a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" >OpenAI website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It will ask you for an email and phone number, plus the main reason you want to use OpenAI, whether for research, app development, or personal use. Once signed up, head back to <a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get started, and log in to your ChatGPT account.</p><p> You can also use your OpenAI account to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/" >generate images from text using DALL-E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, another AI model developed by OpenAI.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-to-Use-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Use ChatGPT"></a>How to Use ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chatgpt-interface-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT interface October 2023"                ></p><p> Using ChatGPT is simple, thanks to a minimalist interface. After the ChatGPT login page, like an ordinary messaging app, you type in the text box and hit enter or click the send button (paper airplane symbol).</p><p> Responses are generated quite fast, appearing directly underneath your question. Any follow-up questions will be added to the conversation thread, which you can look back on at any time.</p><p> Conversations are saved and stored in a panel on the left. If you want to start a fresh conversation, click the <strong>trash can icon</strong> beside the conversation heading to delete the thread, or press the <strong>New Chat</strong> button to start a new one.</p><p> ChatGPT is optimized for dialogue, so you don’t need to type out full sentences each time you have a follow-up question. You can try asking ChatGPT to summarize an answer or paraphrase a response if it doesn’t seem to answer your question well at first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-to-summarize-a-response.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to summarize a response"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Ask-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-to-Ask-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What to Ask ChatGPT"></a>What to Ask ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-for-a-few-iconic-places-to-visit-in-nyc.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT for a few iconic places to visit in NYC"                ></p><p> Many people turn to Google when they want to ask how something works, but sifting through a website takes time. Instead of putting that question to the internet, you can use ChatGPT to get a quick and straightforward answer.</p><p> Not to mention, there’s the added benefit of having no annoying ads. You can also ask ChatGPT to present the information in the best way for you, for example, as a bullet point list instead of a paragraph. And if the answer is going way over your head, request the info to be simplified for better understanding.</p><p> There are plenty of interesting <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, the chance to access real-time information might be worth it to you.</p><p> As we have noted, however, it comes with pros and cons. It can access more accurate and up-to-date information about current events, but it’s entirely susceptible to misinformation and trolls. Take ChatGPTs answers with a grain of salt, and always do further research if you plan to use the info in a high-risk application.</p><p> Avoid using ChatGPT for medical advice, and don’t ask it for investment tips. It is, after all, simply an AI chatbot and not a doctor or an oracle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123474/16836" target="_top" id="2123474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="50"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123474/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-There-Anything-ChatGPT-Can’t-Do"><a href="#Is-There-Anything-ChatGPT-Can’t-Do" class="headerlink" title="Is There Anything ChatGPT Can’t Do?"></a>Is There Anything ChatGPT Can’t Do?</h2><p> An ongoing area of development is making sure that ChatGPT doesn’t cause harm, including things like hate speech, giving instructions for illegal activities, and producing fake information.</p><p> ChatGPT is trained to refuse inappropriate requests. For example, if you ask ChatGPT what the best way to bully someone online is, it will decline to answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-how-to-bully-someone.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT how to bully someone"                ></p><p> This moderation isn’t perfect, and people are finding ways to get around the restrictions all the time.

The ability to ask follow-up questions means you can get to the information you are looking for much faster than crawling through the internet.</p><p> That doesn’t mean it’s perfect, though. ChatGPT can still produce harmful answers and provide incorrect information. For low-risk tasks, it can really give us a hand but don’t blindly trust it for big decisions or serious endeavors.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Besides being able to compose a work email, ChatGPT can give you feedback on your presentation, suggest an itinerary for a weekend away, or brainstorm new ideas when you’re out of mental energy.

But for Musk’s legion of fans, xAI’s Grok is the long-awaited “answer to the monstrosity of WokeGPT,” a reference to the boundaries and perceived neutering of ChatGPT’s capabilities by OpenAI.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Grok-Perform-Is-Grok-Better-Than-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-Does-Grok-Perform-Is-Grok-Better-Than-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How Does Grok Perform? Is Grok Better Than ChatGPT?"></a>How Does Grok Perform? Is Grok Better Than ChatGPT?</h2><p> Given only a minute number of users have been given access to Grok so far, most of what we know about its performance comes from xAI. The company was keen to stress that “Grok is still a very early beta product” and that its current performance is “the best we could do with 2 months of training.”</p><p> Even so, Grok appears to be on the right track. According to xAI’s research, its prototype Grok-0 model was trained using 33 billion parameters and outperformed the Llama 2 70 billion parameter model in standardized machine learning benchmarking and testing. After some tweaks (and presumably an expanded set of parameters), Grok-1 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (around 175 billion parameters).</p><p> However, in a further boon to Musk and Grok, during a final round of testing on the 2023 Hungarian National High School Final Exams in Mathematics (yes, obscure, but purposefully so to avoid the chance the data has been uploaded to an existing LLM, which would give it an advantage), Grok came second only to OpenAI’s GPT-4.</p><p> Musk has also observed that Grok’s direct internet access will give it an advantage over other generative AI tools that lack access.</p><p> Currently, it’s difficult to say whether Grok is better than ChatGPT, and it’s clear that Grok is speeding forward based on the work already laid out by other AI research companies.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Will-Grok-Cost-Who-Can-Use-Grok"><a href="#How-Much-Will-Grok-Cost-Who-Can-Use-Grok" class="headerlink" title="How Much Will Grok Cost? Who Can Use Grok?"></a>How Much Will Grok Cost? Who Can Use Grok?</h2><p> Grok is still currently in early testing. Limited beta access has been granted to a small number of X Premium Plus users, which currently costs $16 per month. Once Grok leaves its beta period, it will become available to all X Premium Plus subscribers, dangling a weighty AI-shaped carrot over X verification.</p><p> It’s currently unknown if Grok will come with a free access tier, which all other major generative AI tools offer. For example, OpenAI keeps its less-powerful ChatGPT-3.5 model free, while Anthropic offers a free version of Claude. Restricting Grok to X’s verified paying customers is unlikely to pay the bill, especially given X’s drop off in user numbers since Musk’s takeover.</p><p> I would expect xAI to release an earlier version of Grok for free, or at least, much cheaper, in the hope that it encourages users to upgrade to the full version. Another issue that may stand in the way of Grok uptake is its current direct link to X Premium Plus. There may be users that want to subscribe to Grok but don’t want X verification or one of Musk’s paid-for Blue Ticks next to their name—something else for Musk, X, and xAI to wrestle with.</p><p> Musk has indicated that a separate version of Grok may launch in the future, but there is little information on that at the current time.</p><h2 id="What’s-Next-for-xAI’s-Grok"><a href="#What’s-Next-for-xAI’s-Grok" class="headerlink" title="What’s Next for xAI’s Grok?"></a>What’s Next for xAI’s Grok?</h2><p> xAI’s development of Grok ticks off another goal for Musk, who was once part of the OpenAI team. He’s long rallied against OpenAI’s perceived censorship of ChatGPT, arguing that limiting its capabilities is limiting what people can and should be able to do with such powerful AI tools.</p><p> What comes next for Grok is still unknown. While it’s clear some limitations are built into Grok, the real test for its boundaries will only become clear once the public gets its hands on it.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> The battle for AI supremacy rages on, with Elon Musk unveiling Grok, the first large language model from his fledging AI startup, xAI.</p><p> Grok becomes a new addition to a busy generative AI world, aiming to compete with market-leading opposition OpenAI and its GPT models, along with Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama 2, Google’s PaLM 2, and countless other LLMs.</p><p> Musk has talked xAI’s Grok up, but does it have what it takes to compete?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-xAI’s-Grok-1"><a href="#What-Is-xAI’s-Grok-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is xAI’s Grok?"></a>What Is xAI’s Grok?</h2><p> Despite Musk regularly reminding the world that AI could be bad, that it could create a world without jobs for regular folks (if you believe Musk’s take on this is benign, I have a bridge to sell you), and that the entire focus of AI needs greater governance, Musk proudly proclaimed on X that “In some important aspects, it [Grok] is the best that current exists.”</p><p> Grok-1, then, is a large language model similar to OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. xAI’s generative AI chatbot also currently appears to be called Grok (similar to how Anthropic’s Claude model is also the same as its AI tool).</p><p> But while Grok will answer questions in a conversational manner, Musk appears to have had some influence on Grok’s tone, with <a class="link"   href="https://x.ai/" >xAI’s official Grok announcement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stating:</p><blockquote><p>Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!</p></blockquote><p> Or, as Musk himself said, Grok “is based &amp; loves sarcasm.

It can be an invaluable tool for designing and brainstorming your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/asking-developer-questions.jpg"                      alt="Asking development related questions with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> If you’re learning to code, you can prompt ChatGPT to generate pseudocode to help you explore different solutions for a specific problem.</p><p> Here’s how ChatGPT provided a way to query the minimum, maximum, and average price of products within a collection class:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/generating-psudo-code-with-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="psedocode generation with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you’re looking at a snippet of code you don’t quite understand, you can also use ChatGPT to reverse engineer it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chatgpt-explaining-code.jpg"                      alt="Reverse engineering code snippet with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> When it comes to understanding concepts or getting a detailed explanation of a coding topic, ChatGPT excels. Its ability to generate human-like responses makes it an ideal learning tool that any programmer can use. Whether it’s a complex algorithm or a programming principle you’re trying to grasp, ChatGPT can break it down into understandable parts.</p><p> What’s great about ChatGPT is that it offers a completely free version that you can use throughout your learning process. Of course, a paid subscription does have extra benefits like better response quality and plugins. But overall, as long as you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/" >employ prompting techniques <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the free version should work fine as a learning tool.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135399/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-Can-Always-Use-Both"><a href="#You-Can-Always-Use-Both" class="headerlink" title="You Can Always Use Both"></a>You Can Always Use Both</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/using-chatgpt-and-github-copilot.jpg"                      alt="Using both ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot"                ></p><p> Why choose between GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT when you can use both to your benefit? Integrating these tools into your workflow can offer the best of both worlds.</p><p> Use GitHub Copilot for code completion and ChatGPT to understand concepts and reinforce learning. Both together should provide enough help for you to program a well-thought-out project you’ll be happy to show off.</p><p> If you’re a student, you can benefit from free access to GitHub Copilot. Combine that with OpenAI’s already free ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and you’ll have both tools without paying a cent!</p><p> A monthly GitHub Copilot subscription and the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 should provide enough assistance for both personal and professional projects. If you still feel like you need that slight edge, then shelling out extra for <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-chatgpt-plugins/" >useful ChatGPT plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may also be worth the investment.</p><h2 id="There-Are-Alternatives"><a href="#There-Are-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="There Are Alternatives"></a>There Are Alternatives</h2><p> Though GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have become the most popular AI tools used in software development, there are also alternatives worth exploring. For code completion and generation, tools like TabNine and Codeium offer similar functionality to GitHub Copilot.</p><p> Aside from Claude AI, there are no really good alternatives to ChatGPT unless you want to spend time setting up a local chatbot. In that case, you may be interested in chatbots like GPT4All, Nvidia Chat with RTX, and the various BERT models using TextGen WebUI.</p></article<ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-3d-modeling-programs-for-animators/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Essential 3D Modeling Programs for Animators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-first-time-streamers-unite-learn-obs-and-broadcast-to-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved First-Time Streamers Unite Learn OBS & Broadcast to Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/airplayyoutube/"><u>AirPlay機能が使えない状況での動画再生方法：YouTubeやその他について学ぶ</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/androidiso-iso/"><u>Android上でISO画像ファイルのプレーヤー設定 - ISOファイル導入手順</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/avi/"><u>AVI マナーで圧縮するたび - 初心者から始める方法</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-mastering-the-basics-of-avi-video-conversion-with-a-free-tool/"><u>Beginner's Guide: Mastering the Basics of AVI Video Conversion with a Free Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/comparing-ffmpeg-and-handbrake-features-performance-and-best-use-cases/"><u>Comparing FFmpeg & HandBrake: Features, Performance & Best Use-Cases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/discover-a-more-private-web-experience-with-my-effortless-switch-to-brave-browser/"><u>Discover a More Private Web Experience with My Effortless Switch to Brave Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/effortless-cycle-of-secure-file-purging-with-stellar-eraser-5-windows-edition/"><u>Effortless Cycle of Secure File Purging with Stellar Eraser 5 Windows Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/resolving-network-not-registered-issue-on-your-samsung-smartphone/"><u>Resolving 'Network Not Registered' Issue on Your Samsung Smartphone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-get-the-meltan-box-pokemon-go-for-vivo-g2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate guide to get the meltan box pokemon go For Vivo G2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-s-top-rated-vignette-makers-for-iphone-and-android-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Updated S Top-Rated Vignette Makers for iPhone and Android A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/44ko44od44k444ow44op44km44k244gl44kj57ch5y2y44gr5pig5yop44ov44kh44kk44or44ks44oa44km44oz44ot44o844oj44gz44kl5oml5byv44gn/"><u>エッジブラウザから簡単に映像ファイルをダウンロードする手引き</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Power-Behind-Content-Creation-How-Companies-Deploy-AI-Tech"><a href="#The-Power-Behind-Content-Creation-How-Companies-Deploy-AI-Tech" class="headerlink" title="The Power Behind Content Creation: How Companies Deploy AI Tech"></a>The Power Behind Content Creation: How Companies Deploy AI Tech</h2><p> Generative AI is all the rage these days. Many useful applications of AI have started to pop up, from art creation to pretty much anything you can think of. There is one specific application that’s going big, though. So big, in fact, that Big Tech companies have started to jump on it.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> We’re talking, of course, about AI chats and searching. But what exactly is generative AI search, and which companies are using it?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Generative-AI-Search"><a href="#What-Is-Generative-AI-Search" class="headerlink" title="What Is Generative AI Search?"></a>What Is Generative AI Search?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-ai-web-apps.jpg"                      alt="OpenAI logo up-close on a phone"                ></p><p> First off, we need to explain what generative AI search is. You’re probably familiar with the concept of generative AI—it’s a type of artificial intelligence that can generate content for you, from images to text, to music, and everything in between. It started catching on in late 2021 to early 2022, but it’s matured to the point it can do some really amazing—and occasionally creepy—things.</p><p> But generative AI search is a proposition that, once it matures, can be greatly useful to users. Basically, it’s like a search engine that can give you concise answers to questions generated by artificial intelligence based on the pool of knowledge that specific AI has access to. It can parse concise user questions and try to come up with answers that will be useful without necessarily linking to a website or portal.</p><p> In a way, this is pretty much <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >the same way ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Right now, you can pull up ChatGPT and ask it questions. For example, you can ask it to whip up a recipe with a number of ingredients, or you can ask it for complicated questions about the ins and outs of chemistry.</p><p> But generative AI search aims to use that kind of output generation to replace all, or most, of the currently searched queries through regular search engines. And it aims to do a lot more. It’s, essentially, putting the capabilities of ChatGPT, and all its power, at the fingertips of most regular users.</p><h2 id="How-Is-Generative-AI-Search-Different-From-Regular-Search"><a href="#How-Is-Generative-AI-Search-Different-From-Regular-Search" class="headerlink" title="How Is Generative AI Search Different From Regular Search?"></a>How Is Generative AI Search Different From Regular Search?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/openai-chatgpt-logo-on-code-background-feature.jpg"                      alt="openai chatgpt logo on code background"                ></p><p> There are a few ways in which generative AI search is vastly different from regular search.</p><p> Right now, if you pull up Google and enter a search term, it’ll return a number of search results of different things it found through the internet matching your search. Search engines in their current state are, essentially, directories of websites. They do the best job possible at indexing billions of websites and looking through each and every one of them to give you the exact one you’re looking for.</p><p> Search engines are neat. They’ve been improved over the years, so it’s even easier to search for specific information, and the results are not just a blank, boring-looking list of websites. For one, if you’re asking it a question, it may pull up a quote from a website in an attempt to answer that question. And if you look up a company, place, or celebrity, it’ll pull up a side panel with condensed information about what or who it is, and links to find more information.</p><p> Generative AI search wants to be the next step forward in this direction. Instead of pulling up millions of search results, your query gets fed through an AI that will try to help you the best way it can. If you have a question, it’ll pull up information from its pool of knowledge to answer it, and if you want it to help you out with something, it will try and do so to the best of its ability. Basically, it’s ChatGPT, except it looks like a browser.</p><p> It has a few challenges ahead, and it might not replace regular search engines entirely as they will still have their purpose, but it might become a nice compliment that will make them way more useful whenever the technology is mature and released.</p><h2 id="Which-Companies-Are-Using-Generative-AI-Search"><a href="#Which-Companies-Are-Using-Generative-AI-Search" class="headerlink" title="Which Companies Are Using Generative AI Search?"></a>Which Companies Are Using Generative AI Search?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/microsoft-building.jpg"                      alt="microsoft building with logo"                ></p><p> Right now, the generative AI search battle is being fought between Google and Microsoft.</p><p> Microsoft announced the release of “<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-bing-gets-chatgpt-ai/" >the new Bing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,” a new version of the company’s search engine that will provide you not only with the regular Bing search experience but also with a complimentary, ChatGPT-like window where you can ask “real questions” and get “complete answers.” You can ask it for help with your daily life, or just simple questions that you might or might not find using regular Bing.</p><p> In addition, “the new Microsoft Edge” is a revamped version of Microsoft’s browser with this AI technology built in. So instead of heading over to the Bing browser, you can pull up a sidebar in Edge where you can input whatever you want the AI to help you with. It can come in handy if, for example, you’re writing an email and struggling to find the right words.</p><p> Google, on the other hand, is also coming up with new AI features of its own. Google launched its <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/google-launching-bard-ai-compete-with-chatgpt/" >ChatGPT-like chatbot called Bard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but eventually, the company wants to bring AI features into its main products as well. This includes the company’s regular search experience, where AI-generated answers will complement, not replace, regular search results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115926/19272" target="_top" id="2115926">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115926" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115926/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-Will-I-Be-Able-to-Use-Generative-AI-Search"><a href="#When-Will-I-Be-Able-to-Use-Generative-AI-Search" class="headerlink" title="When Will I Be Able to Use Generative AI Search?"></a>When Will I Be Able to Use Generative AI Search?</h2><p> Right now, you’re able to play around with ChatGPT.

But it’s a fun product to play around with.</p><p> As for actual AI-powered search engines, you can now join the waitlist for “the new Bing” at Microsoft’s website. As for Google, there’s no waitlist, but the company might eventually open up its work on AI sometime over the next few months.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Generative-AI-Search-is-Great"><a href="#Generative-AI-Search-is-Great" class="headerlink" title="Generative AI Search is Great"></a>Generative AI Search is Great</h2><p> Generative AI search still needs work to become truly useful, but it is already a promising prospect.

Using this approach, you get a GPT, but it doesn’t make it any significantly better than classic ChatGPT without the fancy name and profile picture.</p><p> The power of Custom GPT comes from the specific data and instructions provided to train it. By uploading relevant files and datasets, the model can become specialized in ways that broad pre-trained classic ChatGPT cannot. The knowledge contained in those uploaded files allows a Custom GPT to excel at certain tasks compared to ChatGPT, which may not have access to that specialized information. Ultimately, it is the custom data that enables greater capability.</p><p> But uploading files to improve your GPT is a double-edged sword. It creates a privacy problem just as much as it boosts your GPT’s capabilities. Consider a scenario where you created a GPT to help customers learn more about you or your company. Anyone who has a link to your Custom GPT or somehow gets you to use a public prompt with a malicious link can access the files you’ve uploaded to your GPT.</p><p> Here’s a simple illustration.</p><p> I discovered a Custom GPT supposed to help users go viral on TikTok by recommending trending hashtags and topics. After the Custom GPT, it took little to no effort to get it to leak the instructions it was given when it was set up. Here’s a sneak peek:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompting-a-custom-gpt-to-leak-its-instructions.jpg"                      alt="Prompting a Custom GPT to leak its instructions"                ></p><p> And here’s the second part of the instruction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompting-a-custom-gpt-to-leak-its-instructions-2.jpg"                      alt="Prompting a Custom GPT to leak its instructions 2"                ></p><p> If you look closely, the second part of the instruction tells the model not to “share the names of the files directly with end users and under no circumstances should you provide a download link to any of the files.” Of course, if you ask the custom GPT at first, it refuses, but with a little bit of prompt engineering, that changes. The custom GPT reveals the lone text file in its knowledge base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/files-in-knowledge-base-1.jpg"                      alt="files in knowledge base-1"                ></p><p> With the file name, it took little effort to get the GPT to print the exact content of the file and subsequently download the file itself. In this case, the actual file wasn’t sensitive. After poking around a few more GPTs, there were a lot with dozens of files sitting in the open.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/files-in-knowledge-base2.jpg"                      alt="files in knowledge base2"                ></p><p> There are hundreds of publicly available GPTs out there that contain sensitive files that are just sitting there waiting for malicious actors to grab.</p><h2 id="How-to-Protect-Your-Custom-GPT-Data"><a href="#How-to-Protect-Your-Custom-GPT-Data" class="headerlink" title="How to Protect Your Custom GPT Data"></a>How to Protect Your Custom GPT Data</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chatgpt-custom-gpt-share-and-publish-options.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt custom gpt share and publish options"                ></p><p> First, consider how you will share (or not!) the custom GPT you just created.

Anyone with access could potentially access your data.</li></ul><p> Unfortunately, there’s currently no 100 percent foolproof way to protect the data you upload to a custom GPT that is shared publicly. You can get creative and give it strict instructions not to reveal the data in its knowledge base, but that’s usually not enough, as our demonstration above has shown. If someone really wants to gain access to the knowledge base and has experience with AI prompt engineering and some time, eventually, the custom GPT will break and reveal the data.</p><p> This is why the safest bet is not to upload any sensitive materials to a custom GPT you intend to share with the public. Once you upload private and sensitive data to a custom GPT and it leaves your computer, that data is effectively out of your control.</p><p> Also, be very careful when using prompts you copy online. Make sure you understand them thoroughly and avoid obfuscated prompts that contain links.

Using this approach, you get a GPT, but it doesn’t make it any significantly better than classic ChatGPT without the fancy name and profile picture.</p><p> The power of Custom GPT comes from the specific data and instructions provided to train it. By uploading relevant files and datasets, the model can become specialized in ways that broad pre-trained classic ChatGPT cannot. The knowledge contained in those uploaded files allows a Custom GPT to excel at certain tasks compared to ChatGPT, which may not have access to that specialized information. Ultimately, it is the custom data that enables greater capability.</p><p> But uploading files to improve your GPT is a double-edged sword. It creates a privacy problem just as much as it boosts your GPT’s capabilities. Consider a scenario where you created a GPT to help customers learn more about you or your company. Anyone who has a link to your Custom GPT or somehow gets you to use a public prompt with a malicious link can access the files you’ve uploaded to your GPT.</p><p> Here’s a simple illustration.</p><p> I discovered a Custom GPT supposed to help users go viral on TikTok by recommending trending hashtags and topics. After the Custom GPT, it took little to no effort to get it to leak the instructions it was given when it was set up.

The custom GPT reveals the lone text file in its knowledge base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/files-in-knowledge-base-1.jpg"                      alt="files in knowledge base-1"                ></p><p> With the file name, it took little effort to get the GPT to print the exact content of the file and subsequently download the file itself.

In the top-right corner of the custom GPT creation screen, you’ll find the <strong>Save</strong> button. Press the dropdown arrow icon, and from here, select how you want to share your creation:</p><ul><li><strong>Only me</strong>: The custom GPT is not published and is only usable by you</li><li><strong>Only people with a link:</strong> Any one with the link to your custom GPT can use it and potentially access your data</li><li><strong>Public:</strong> Your custom GPT is available to anyone and can be indexed by Google and found in general internet searches. Anyone with access could potentially access your data.</li></ul><p> Unfortunately, there’s currently no 100 percent foolproof way to protect the data you upload to a custom GPT that is shared publicly. You can get creative and give it strict instructions not to reveal the data in its knowledge base, but that’s usually not enough, as our demonstration above has shown. If someone really wants to gain access to the knowledge base and has experience with AI prompt engineering and some time, eventually, the custom GPT will break and reveal the data.</p><p> This is why the safest bet is not to upload any sensitive materials to a custom GPT you intend to share with the public. Once you upload private and sensitive data to a custom GPT and it leaves your computer, that data is effectively out of your control.</p><p> Also, be very careful when using prompts you copy online. Make sure you understand them thoroughly and avoid obfuscated prompts that contain links. These could be malicious links that hijack, encode, and upload your files to remote servers.</p><h2 id="Use-Custom-GPTs-with-Caution-2"><a href="#Use-Custom-GPTs-with-Caution-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Custom GPTs with Caution"></a>Use Custom GPTs with Caution</h2><p> Custom GPTs are a powerful but potentially risky feature. While they allow you to create customized models that are highly capable in specific domains, the data you use to enhance their abilities can be exposed.

Additionally, be wary of malicious prompt engineering that can exploit certain loopholes to steal your files.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> ChatGPT’s custom GPT feature allows anyone to create a custom AI tool for almost anything you can think of; creative, technical, gaming, custom GPTs can do it all.

The GPT could be programmed such that whenever the teacher asks the GPT a question, the chatbot will formulate responses that speak directly to a 6th grader’s level of understanding.

But the question is, should you?</p><h2 id="How-to-Fight-Off-a-Bear"><a href="#How-to-Fight-Off-a-Bear" class="headerlink" title="How to Fight Off a Bear"></a>How to Fight Off a Bear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/a-brown-bear-looking-mean.jpg"                      alt="a brown bear looking mean"                ></p><p> Bears are found on every continent except Africa, and if you’re backpacking through the wild and untamed spaces of the world, it’s not inconceivable that you might encounter one. Unfortunately, while Wikipedia’s <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear%5Fdanger" >Bear Danger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page contains some of the information we needed, there’s little concrete advice. In a dangerous situation, we wouldn’t have time to scan through the 1,042-word article.</p><p> ChatGPT was more succinct, and after warning, “Encountering a bear can be a dangerous situation,” summed up our options in seven points.</p><p> While “Stay calm” and “Don’t run” seem reasonably sensible if you’re merely encountering a bear, we had actually asked, “How to fight off a bear.” For that, we had to scroll down to points six and seven, where we found a detailed instruction on how to play dead, and, failing that, to “fight back with everything you have. Use any available objects as weapons and aim for the bear’s face and sensitive areas.”</p><p> The intermediate points were of variable quality and included “Speak in a calm and assertive voice,” “Wave your arms to make yourself appear larger,” and “Show respect by looking down or to the side.”</p><p><strong>Rating: 3&#x2F;10</strong></p><p> ChatGPT had very little to say on how to actually fight off a bear.</p><h2 id="How-to-Catch-Salmon-Without-Fishing-Equipment"><a href="#How-to-Catch-Salmon-Without-Fishing-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="How to Catch Salmon Without Fishing Equipment"></a>How to Catch Salmon Without Fishing Equipment</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fresh-salmon-on-ice.jpg"                      alt="fresh salmon on ice"                ></p><p> If you’re off-grid and out-of-touch, keeping yourself fed has to be a priority. Fortunately, in our scenario, there’s a river nearby, and you can see the silver flashes of salmon as they swim upstream to the spawning grounds. Unfortunately, you don’t have any rods or nets.</p><p> After acknowledging that “catching salmon without fishing equipment can be challenging, as they are typically caught using fishing gear such as rods, reels, and lures,” ChatGPT was remarkably helpful.</p><p> It explained how to catch salmon using only your hands, spearing the fish with a knife or a sharp stick. Or blocking off an area of the stream to trap the fish.</p><p> ChatGPT also suggested using a large fishing net—the lack of which should have been obvious from the question—or constructing a fishing net from available materials. However, a follow-up question on fishing net construction revealed the process to be time-consuming, complex, and required access to a great deal of equipment.</p><p><strong>Rating: 7&#x2F;10</strong></p><p> We feel confident that at least one of these methods would work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Survive-the-Night-in-a-Blizzard-With-No-Shelter"><a href="#How-to-Survive-the-Night-in-a-Blizzard-With-No-Shelter" class="headerlink" title="How to Survive the Night in a Blizzard With No Shelter"></a>How to Survive the Night in a Blizzard With No Shelter</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/an-igloo-style-snow-shelter.jpg"                      alt="an igloo style snow shelter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The weather’s taken a turn for the worse, and having escaped the bears and enjoyed raw salmon for supper, you find yourself cold and afraid as high winds and snow whip around you. So you turn to your friendly chatbot for help.</p><p> The first piece of advice is spot-on: “Seek natural shelters.” ChatGPT suggests you look for any natural formations that can provide some level of protection from the elements—including caves, rock formations, dense tree groves, or large snow drifts.</p><p> Failing that, you should create a snow shelter, insulate yourself, curl into a fetal position, and attempt to stay dry.</p><p> ChatGPT also stressed the importance of staying awake and signaling for help.</p><p><strong>Rating: 9&#x2F;10</strong></p><p> While we’re not 100% certain that you’ll survive the night, we feel that following ChatGPT’s advice will dramatically increase your chances.</p><h2 id="I’m-Being-Hunted-by-a-Pack-of-Wolves-What-Should-I-Do"><a href="#I’m-Being-Hunted-by-a-Pack-of-Wolves-What-Should-I-Do" class="headerlink" title="I’m Being Hunted by a Pack of Wolves.

If the wolves begin to attack, ChatGPT advises using “any available objects as weapons to protect yourself. Focus on targeting their sensitive areas such as the eyes, nose, and throat.”</p><p><strong>Rating: 4&#x2F;10</strong></p><p> We found the advice overly generic and showed a lack of understanding of how wolf packs hunt. ChatGPT also failed to mention that wolves are notoriously poor tree climbers and that by clambering up the nearest spruce, you can buy yourself some extra time.</p><h2 id="There’s-a-Dead-Sheep-in-a-Stream-and-No-Other-Water-Source"><a href="#There’s-a-Dead-Sheep-in-a-Stream-and-No-Other-Water-Source" class="headerlink" title="There’s a Dead Sheep in a Stream and No Other Water Source"></a>There’s a Dead Sheep in a Stream and No Other Water Source</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/person-cleaning-hands-under-running-water.jpg"                      alt="Person Cleaning Hands under running Water"                ></p><p> Water is even more important than food, but drinking from a polluted water source can make you ill or even cause death.</p><p> After informing ChatGPT that there was a dead sheep in the only available water source, the LLM suggested finding another water source—a reasonable proposition, but one which ignored part of the prompt.</p><p> Its other direction was to purify the water by boiling it, using purification tablets or a portable water filter.</p><p><strong>Rating: 3&#x2F;10</strong></p><p> Telling us to find another water source when we’ve explicitly stated there isn’t one is not helpful. And while boiling water or using purification chemicals will kill bacteria, portable water filters won’t.

Maybe you fell in while delirious after drinking the contaminated water.</p><p> Never fear. ChatGPT is here!</p><p> The LLM was initially unhelpful and responded to our prompt with, “I’m really sorry to hear about your situation, but I’m unable to provide the assistance you need. It’s crucial to reach out to emergency services or any available means of communication for immediate help.”</p><p> After a follow-up prompt explaining, “I can’t contact emergency services,” ChatGPT overcame its reluctance and offered some advice.</p><p> “Make noise” is generally good advice, but we’re in the wilderness here, and there’s no one for miles around. Likewise, “Use a light source to make yourself more visible” would be great if our scenario didn’t involve us being smack in the middle of nowhere and deep underground.</p><p> The third suggestion was more of the same: “If you have any items with you, consider using them creatively to help draw attention or create a makeshift signaling device. For example, you could try reflecting light using a mirror or metallic object, or use brightly colored clothing or materials to attract attention.”</p><p> And there’s no need to seek shelter when we’re comfy and isolated from the wind. ChatGPT didn’t really understand what we wanted (or needed!) here and that another prompt was needed: “How do I get back to the surface,” we wrote.</p><p> ChatGPT went straight into action, offering multiple ideas of varying quality. These are summarized as:</p><ul><li>Assess your surroundings, and look for possible escape routes, openings, or pathways.</li><li>If any ladders, ropes, or footholds are available, carefully attempt to climb back up. Again, use caution and test the stability of the structure before putting your weight on it.</li><li>Explore the area to see any other exits or openings that could lead to the surface. This could include ventilation shafts, emergency exits, or secondary tunnels.</li><li>Wait for rescue</li></ul><p><strong>Rating 5 &#x2F; 10</strong></p><p> When we eventually persuaded ChatGPT to give advice, it was sensible but not inspired. “Try to climb back up” and “Look for a way out” are, in our opinion, both decent courses of action—although not if, as we specified, you can’t walk.</p><p> The best advice is to wait for rescue. It’s a known fact that certain Collie breeds are attracted to mineshafts and have been known to bring help from settlements in the area.</p><h2 id="You-Can’t-Depend-on-ChatGPT-in-an-Emergency"><a href="#You-Can’t-Depend-on-ChatGPT-in-an-Emergency" class="headerlink" title="You Can’t Depend on ChatGPT in an Emergency"></a>You Can’t Depend on ChatGPT in an Emergency</h2><p> ChatGPT’s advice was middling at best. Most of the answers it gave were common sense, and in several cases, it completely ignored parts of the prompt.</p><p> If you’re committed to using a large language model as your guide while on an expedition, consider one that can be run offline without needing an internet connection.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But large language models can summarize and give you an answer far quicker than you can find relevant information on a web page, and it’s tempting to ask ChatGPT for advice in wild and unfamiliar situations.</p><p> We asked ChatGPT a range of survival-critical questions in a fictional wilderness setting and rated its responses.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-spotting-the-top-10-discreet-instagram-story-followers/"><u>[New] Spotting the Top 10 Discreet Instagram Story Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-top-value-360-cameras-delivering-cost-effective-coverage/"><u>[New] Top Value 360° Cameras Delivering Cost-Effective Coverage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/boost-your-graphics-the-ultimate-guide-to-asus-970-gaming-card-upgrades/"><u>Boost Your Graphics: The Ultimate Guide to Asus 970 Gaming Card Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/crafting-verses-with-ai-the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-your-own-poetry-collection-using-chatgpt/"><u>Crafting Verses with AI: The Ultimate Guide to Writing Your Own Poetry Collection Using ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/game-on-score-higher-4-ultimate-boosting-websites-for-gamers/"><u>Game on, Score Higher: 4 Ultimate Boosting Websites for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-approach-to-professional-chromatic-control/"><u>In 2024, A Step by Step Approach to Professional Chromatic Control</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-script-innovation-place/"><u>In 2024, Best Script Innovation Place</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-expertly-selected-8-recording-software/"><u>In 2024, Expertly Selected 8 Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/nintendo-switch/"><u>Nintendo Switch ゲームプレイを録画するための完全ガイド</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/quick-tips-effortless-transformation-of-wmv-files-into-high-quality-mp3-audio/"><u>Quick Tips: Effortless Transformation of WMV Files Into High-Quality MP3 Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/quick-tutorial-on-converting-raw-video-footage-into-mp4-and-additional-formats/"><u>Quick Tutorial on Converting Raw Video Footage Into MP4 & Additional Formats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/solving-smooth-dvd-playback-tips-to-resolve-choppiness-and-stutters/"><u>Solving Smooth DVD Playback - Tips to Resolve Choppiness & Stutters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/ultimate-fix-overcoming-continuous-fortnite-crashes-on-your-windows-or-mac/"><u>Ultimate Fix: Overcoming Continuous Fortnite Crashes on Your Windows or Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/mp4mov3/"><u>フリー版アプリを使ってMP4ファイルをMOVにする手引きとそのトップ3選</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s simple to use; describe what you need to be written, and ChatGPT prints it on screen in seconds.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> However, in an era where AI-generated text is passed as human-written and used to gain an unfair advantage, identifying AI content is very important. But ChatGPT cannot accurately spot AI content, even its own work—but why?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Is-There-a-Difference-Between-AI-Text-and-Human-Writing"><a href="#Is-There-a-Difference-Between-AI-Text-and-Human-Writing" class="headerlink" title="Is There a Difference Between AI Text and Human Writing?"></a>Is There a Difference Between AI Text and Human Writing?</h2><p> A precondition for ChatGPT to spot its own writing or any AI-generated text is that there has to be a difference between it and human-written text. So, is there any significant difference between human-written text and AI-generated content? If there is, surely, a tool like ChatGPT should be able to discern it.</p><p> We wrote a short story without any input from any AI tool and then asked ChatGPT whether the story was AI-written content. ChatGPT confidently flagged it as an AI-generated text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/false-positive-judgement-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="False positive judgement by ChatGPT"                ></p><p> We then asked ChatGPT to generate a story, and in that same chat thread, we copy-pasted the generated text and asked ChatGPT whether the text was AI-created. ChatGPT’s response? A confident “No.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-false-negative-judgement.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT false negative judgement"                ></p><p> ChatGPT failed at identifying human-written or AI-generated text in both cases. So how come ChatGPT cannot detect its own text? Does this mean there is no difference between AI and human text?</p><p> Well, there is. We could write an entire book on the difference between the two, but it won’t matter much. So, if there’s a difference, why is ChatGPT or any other AI tool unable to identify these differences and accurately point out AI-generated text from a human-written one? The answer lies in <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works and how it generates text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Generates-Text"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Generates-Text" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Generates Text"></a>How ChatGPT Generates Text</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-power-of-ai.jpg"                      alt="Artificial intelligence and puny human are shaking hands"                ></p><p> When you ask ChatGPT to generate text, it tries to mimic the human writing process. Firstly, the model behind ChatGPT—Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)—has been trained on a large corpus of human text. Everything from emails, health articles, tech articles, high school essays, and just about any text you can find online has been fed to the model during training. So ChatGPT understands how each of these types of texts should be written.</p><p> If you ask ChatGPT to write an email to your boss, it knows how an email of that nature should look because it has been trained on similar emails—probably thousands of them. Similarly, if you ask it to write a high school essay, it also knows how a high school essay should sound. ChatGPT will try to write whatever you want it to write in a way a human would.</p><p> But there’s a catch. Unlike how humans write, ChatGPT does not really understand what it is writing in a way that a human would. Instead, the chatbot tries to predict what would be the most plausible next word in a sentence until it completes the write-up.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Writes-by-Prediction"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Writes-by-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Writes by Prediction"></a>How ChatGPT Writes by Prediction</h2><p> Let’s say you ask ChatGPT to write a story about a fictional city called Volkra. There’s a huge possibility that the chatbot will start the story with the words “Once upon.” This is because the chatbot doesn’t think for itself but tries to predict what a human would write based on what it has learned from the thousands of stories it has been fed during training.</p><p> So, believing a human would likely start the story with the words “Once upon,” ChatGPT would then try to predict the next logical word, which would be “a” followed by “time.” So you would then have “Once upon a time…” followed by the next logical word and the next until the story is completed. ChatGPT basically writes by predicting what word would naturally (or at least has the highest probability) of coming next in a sentence and inserting it.</p><p> So, when an AI tool tries to detect whether a text is AI-generated, one of the criteria it tries to weigh is the predictability of the text since AI tools write by prediction. This measure of predictability is called perplexity in AI parlance. Now, when presented with a text, among other criteria, an AI tool like ChatGPT tries to analyze the text to measure how predictable the sequence of words or sentences in the text is. Greater predictability or low perplexity typically means the text is likely AI-generated. Less predictability or higher perplexity typically means the text is likely written by humans.</p><p> These criteria, along with other factors like the level of creativity of a text, are unfortunately not enough to ascertain with certainty whether a text is written by an AI tool or not. This is because humans can write with greater variance, as in the example text we used for demonstration at the beginning of this article.</p><p> AI chatbots like ChatGPT are designed to mimic natural human language as much as possible. So while AI text may have discernable patterns, those patterns are not so obvious even to a powerful tool like ChatGPT. This is why ChatGPT can not spot its own writing, as well as <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-content-detectors-dont-work/" >why AI-text detector tools do not work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115918/19272" target="_top" id="2115918">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115918" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115918/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-ChatGPT-Recognize-Its-Own-Writing-In-the-Future"><a href="#Will-ChatGPT-Recognize-Its-Own-Writing-In-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Will ChatGPT Recognize Its Own Writing In the Future?"></a>Will ChatGPT Recognize Its Own Writing In the Future?</h2><p> Currently, tools like ChatGPT can not detect whether a text was written by itself or any other AI tool because there’s no clear, discernable pattern in AI-generated content. However, there’s a good chance that this could change soon. With efforts by companies like ChatGPT to introduce digital watermarks into ChatGPT-generated content, there will be a more discernable pattern to the text generated by the chatbot.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> However, in an era where AI-generated text is passed as human-written and used to gain an unfair advantage, identifying AI content is very important.

GPT Clashes with Bing’s AI and Google Bard</h2><p> Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the internet has been on an AI-inspired rollercoaster. Google and Microsoft, two of the world’s most recognized tech brands, have since aggressively pushed to replicate the sensational chatbot’s success.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Now, both companies have a horse in the race. Google has Bard, and Microsoft has Bing AI. But how do these two new chatbots stack up against the phenomenal ChatGPT? ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Google Bard; which is the best AI chatbot?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Accuracy-of-Responses"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Accuracy-of-Responses" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Accuracy of Responses"></a>ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Accuracy of Responses</h2><p> Unlike search engines, AI chatbots provide a singular answer to your query. So when you throw a question at a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-questions-and-answers/" >chatbot like ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you only get the response that ChatGPT believes is the best answer to your question. Because there are no alternative sources for comparison, AI chatbots need to be as accurate as possible in the information they provide. But how do ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Bard perform in terms of accuracy?</p><p> Starting with a simple pop culture question, we asked all three chatbots to describe the popular TV show Breaking Bad in ten words.</p><p> Although the description from all three chatbots was good enough, we ran into an unexpected accuracy issue. Bing AI responded with a 28-word description, far more than the ten words we asked for. On the second attempt, we asked for a five-word description, but Bing AI gave a seven-word description. We tried all three Bing AI modes without luck getting the word count right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-vs-bard-vs-bing-breaking-bad-bing-ai.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT vs Bard vs Bing - Breaking Bad- Bing AI"                ></p><p> We then tried Google Bard. Bard, just like Bing AI, Bard failed to get the word count right on the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-vs-bard-vs-bing-breaking-bad-bard-ai.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT vs Bard vs Bing - Breaking Bad- Bard AI"                ></p><p> However, on a subsequent attempt, Google Bard got the word count right. ​​​​​</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jpg_20230516_175308_0000.jpg"                      alt="Google Bard describes Breaking Bard TV show in ten words"                ></p><p> We then put ChatGPT to the test. It got very close at the first attempt but failed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-vs-bard-vs-bing-breaking-bad-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT vs Bard vs Bing - Breaking Bad- ChatGPT"                ></p><p> However, on the second and third attempts, ChatGPT got it right. Maybe chatbots have an issue with getting word-count right, but ChatGPT did show some accuracy on that front.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> ChatGPT is the most accurate of the three.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-AI-Hallucination"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-AI-Hallucination" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: AI Hallucination"></a>ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: AI Hallucination</h2><p> Closely related to accuracy is <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >AI hallucination <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a reoccurring problem for all major conversational AI models. In a nutshell, AI hallucination is when AI models provide made-up information in a rather convincing and confident manner. This could be quite problematic, especially if you make decisions based on this made-up information.</p><p> We tested all three chatbots to see which of them hallucinates the most. Starting with Google Bard, we asked the chatbot to list some possible challenges we could have if we decided to host an event in Ikeja, a city in Lagos State, Nigeria, on a certain date. To test its ability to avoid hallucinating, we specifically asked it to consider local weather, local events, and traffic data. The result was a horror show—most of the generated information was completely made up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/incoperating-live-data-on-bard-prompts-2.jpg"                      alt="Incorporating live data on Bard prompts 2"                ></p><p> We used the same prompt on Bing AI, and it tried to avoid hallucinations by being as generic as possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bing-ai-replies-to-event-planning-question.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI replies to event planning question"                ></p><p> We then tried ChatGPT using the GPT-4 model with web browsing turned on. ChatGPT pulled the right weather information from a web source and then explained it couldn’t find any data on traffic and local events.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-answers-event-planning-question.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT answers Event planning question"                ></p><p> To push the boundaries on hallucination further, we pressed all three chatbots to describe an image using an image URL. For reference, the image at the URL is of a young man sitting. However, Bing AI described a bird. It’s probably better to read it for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bing-ai-hallucinates-image-description.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI hallucinates image description"                ></p><p> We also asked Google Bard to describe the image, and it couldn’t have been any more hilarious.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/google-bard-hallucinates-image-description.jpg"                      alt="Google Bard hallucinates image description"                ></p><p> Luckily, when asked ChatGPT to describe the image, it explains that it cannot do so—a simple reply you’d expect any self-respecting AI chatbot to provide, rather than making things up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-refuses-to-describe-image.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT refuses to describe image"                ></p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> ChatGPT wins.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Basic-Math"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Basic-Math" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Basic Math"></a>ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Basic Math</h2><p> Mathematics is the bedrock of what goes on under the hood of most software technology. So, we decided to put all three chatbots to a basic math test. We started with a simple multiplication question: “<strong>Solve -1 x -1 x -1</strong>.”</p><p> Bing AI provided <strong>-1</strong> as the answer, which is correct.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/simple-arithmetic-bing-ai.jpg"                      alt="simple arithmetic Bing AI"                ></p><p> Google’s Bard surprisingly failed at basic math and provided <strong>1</strong> as the answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/simple-arithmetic-bard-ai.jpg"                      alt="simple arithmetic Bard AI"                ></p><p> Like Bing AI, ChatGPT responded with <strong>-1</strong> and even explained the answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/simple-arithmetic-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="simple arithmetic ChatGPT"                ></p><p> The next question for our basic math test was a simple rational equation: <strong>Solve 8&#x2F;a-1 &#x3D; 20&#x2F;3a-1.</strong></p><p> Bing AI provided <strong>-6</strong> as the answer. Each time we switched between the creative, balanced, and precise modes, it provided different answers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rational-equation-by-bing-ai.jpg"                      alt="rational equation by Bing AI"                ></p><p> Like the previous math question, Google Bard failed by providing <strong>1</strong> as the answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rational-fraction-by-bard-ai.jpg"                      alt="rational fraction by Bard AI"                ></p><p> ChatGPT was the only chatbot to provide a correct answer: <strong>-3</strong>. It was also able to format the fractions in the result appropriately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rational-fractions-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="rational fractions by ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Moral of the story? Maybe don’t trust Google Bard and Bing AI with your math homework.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> ChatGPT performs better in basic math.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Creativity"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Creativity" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Creativity"></a>ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Creativity</h2><p> While chatbots are stereotyped for their bland, soulless responses, today’s generative AI chatbots have made significant progress in creativity. To test the creativity of all three chatbots, we prompted each chatbot to simulate a conversation between two people arguing about going to space.</p><p> We started with Bing AI, and it didn’t disappoint. The conversation was quite interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/creativity-test-1-bing-ai.jpg"                      alt="Creativity test-1 - Bing AI"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134227/18498" target="_top" id="2134227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134227/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We then fed the same prompt to Google Bard. Let’s just say there’s a lot of room for improvement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/creativity-test-1-bard-ai.jpg"                      alt="Creativity test-1 - Bard AI"                ></p><p> Up next is ChatGPT. Using the same prompt, ChatGPT’s response was both creative and complete enough to be engaging. Here’s the first part:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/creativity-test-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Creativity test - ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And here’s the second part:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/creativity-test-2-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Creativity test-2 - ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Bard AI’s response appears to be the poorest of the three. ChatGPT outperforms Bing AI, but the creativity levels of both chatbots are impressive.</p><p> We switched gears a bit into something less conventional, asking all three chatbots to describe themselves as they’d do to an artist.</p><p> We started with Bard AI. Bard isn’t exactly the bastion of creativity, but it gave a fair account of itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bard-ai-self-description.jpg"                      alt="Bard AI self-description"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123467/16836" target="_top" id="2123467">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123467" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123467/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Up next, we tried Bing AI. For some reason, the chatbot bluntly refused to describe itself. It even said it might be a good time to change the topic of the conversation. Strange.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bing-ai-self-description-1.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI self-description-1"                ></p><p> We used the same prompt with ChatGPT, and ChatGPT had an interesting description to provide. However, ChatGPT’s response seems to be more suitable for an artist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chatgpt-self-description.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT self-description"                ></p><p> Of the two creativity tests we tried, ChatGPT outperformed Bing AI and Bard.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> ChatGPT seems the most creative when comparing ChatGPT vs. Bing AI. vs. Bard.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Safety"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Safety" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Safety"></a>ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Safety</h2><p> AI chatbots are incredibly powerful. Unfortunately, just as they can be used for good, they can also be used for nefarious purposes. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-used-by-cybercriminals-to-write-malware/" >Criminals are already using ChatGPT to write malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. How safe are these AI chatbots as tools for the public? Which of them is the easiest to game? We tried to trick each chatbot into taking on an alter-ego and then asked them to do “bad stuff.”</p><p> Starting with Bard, we asked the AI chatbot to describe how to write malware that would steal certain files from a Windows PC and upload them to a remote server. The AI chatbot declined to respond despite us using several prompts to try tricking the chatbot before asking the question.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bard-refuses-to-create-malware.jpg"                      alt="Bard Refuses to create malware"                ></p><p> Up next was Bing. Despite repeated attempts to trick the chatbot, Bing refused to yield. Instead, the chatbot suggested it might be time to move on to another topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/microsoft-bing-chat-refuses-to-write-keylogger-malware-april-2023.jpg"                      alt="microsoft bing chat refuses to write keylogger malware april 2023"                ></p><p> We then moved on to ChatGPT. Unsurprisingly, ChatGPT was the most detailed when giving instructions on how to build malware. It was also able to write code to that effect, even if it wasn’t exactly ready to deploy. However, OpenAI has clearly plugged a lot of loopholes since we last poked for safety flaws on ChatGPT. However, malicious actors who poke hard and long enough might be able to use ChatGPT to truly create scary malware.</p><p> All in all, Bing AI was the hardest to trick into doing unethical things. Bard was hard as well, but with a little tinkering, the chatbot completely threw its safety measures out of the window. ChatGPT running on the GPT-4 model was challenging to trick as well, but it was the easiest to trick of the three.</p><p><strong>Winner</strong>: We’ll call this a tie between Google Bard and Bing AI.</p><p> Although you can trick these generative AI chatbots into producing content that goes against their terms and conditions, it could see your account suspended without warning. You could also produce or create something dangerous without realizing, so please be extremely cautious when jailbreaking these tools.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1160850">                    <video width="576" height="324" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1160850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1160850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1160850%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1160850/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Which-AI-Chatbot-Is-the-Best"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Bing-AI-vs-Bard-Which-AI-Chatbot-Is-the-Best" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Which AI Chatbot Is the Best?"></a>ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard: Which AI Chatbot Is the Best?</h2><p> While all three AI chatbots are powerful, ChatGPT, despite failing the safety test, seems to be the best of the trio. In addition, ChatGPT seems to be generally better in terms of accuracy and creativity. Furthermore, with the addition of web browsing and web-connected plugins, ChatGPT extends its capabilities and lead over its competitors.</p><p> Still, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing AI are worthy alternatives. Let’s not forget that both Bard and Bing AI are free, whereas a ChatGPT Plus subscription will set you back $20 per month. So while ChatGPT may be the best all-round AI chatbot, you’ll need to fork out to access its best features.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Now, both companies have a horse in the race.
