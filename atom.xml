Not many people know that you can also <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-read-pdf-ways/" >ask ChatGPT to read your PDFs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and chat about their contents. But if that’s your objective, then these apps offer better options, from increased database sizes to creating chatbots from multiple documents.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><h2 id="1-Unriddle"><a href="#1-Unriddle" class="headerlink" title="1.

The first of those five is when you create a bot to analyze a file, so it’ll be only four questions or messages after that. If you plan to use this app, you’ll need to upgrade to the pro ($20 &#x2F; month) or premium ($50 &#x2F; month) plan very quickly.</p><p> But given Unriddle’s performance, it’s well worth it. The app uses GPT-4 and is built purely to analyze documents to give answers only from the material given to that bot. Unriddle claims it can handle around 500,000 words, which is far more than ChatGPT’s capacity of 4,000 words.</p><p> Chrome users can also download the Unriddle Summarize extension to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ways-to-read-long-articles/" >read any long article easily <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The AI will analyze and summarize articles in a jiffy, and you can also ask follow-up questions to the bot without leaving the page.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Unriddle Summarize for <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unriddle-ai-generated-sum/iinmigjlcpeckfihbbfajpkiilfmakff" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="2-Chatterdocs"><a href="#2-Chatterdocs" class="headerlink" title="2.

Essentially, you’re creating a chatbot by simply uploading your materials or importing a website.</p><p> You can add up to three files for a bot in the free version and then choose which of those sources you want to keep active. Chatterdocs uses ChatGPT to understand queries and give answers. In our tests, we found that you need to be precise in your chat prompts to get the right information.</p><p> Unregistered users can also use <a class="link"   href="https://chatterdocs.ai/tools/chat-with-pdf" >Chatterdocs to analyze PDF files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a free tool to see how much Chatterdocs can do.</p><h2 id="3-Klavier"><a href="#3-Klavier" class="headerlink" title="3. Klavier"></a>3.

That alone makes it worth using over several other alternatives, especially if you plan to ask many queries. Klavier can also analyze web pages to summarize articles.</p><p> However, Klavier was definitely slower than other apps. And while it uses the same GPT AI that others are using, the answers weren’t as in-depth as what you get in Unriddle. But given it’s completely free and unlimited, that’s hardly a complaint.</p><p> Currently, you cannot create an account on Klavier to store analyzed files. In fact, you can only work with one source material at a time and will lose any progress if you add a new source for Klavier to analyze.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-LXI-ai"><a href="#4-LXI-ai" class="headerlink" title="4.

But it’s quite interesting that you pay according to your usage, not by preset plans. It costs $0.1 per MB per month for the amount of data you have uploaded. And every question you ask costs $0.0025, which you can avoid if you have your own OpenAI API key. So you have control over the actual price you’ll pay.</p><p> The chatbot works with all your documents at the same time, so you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-chrome-extensions-better-ai-prompts-answers-in-browsers/" >learn to phrase ChatGPT prompts effectively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the answers you need. It’s also context-unaware, meaning each question is treated as a separate query without considering the conversation before it.</p><h2 id="5-Docalysis"><a href="#5-Docalysis" class="headerlink" title="5.

Open a file to show the file contents on the left and a chat window on the right. The app uses ChatGPT to understand and answer your queries based on the information Docalysis feeds it.</p><p> You can only work with one document at a time, with no option of querying Docalysis about multiple documents together. The chatbot remembers the context of a current conversation but won’t remember previous sessions once you close the window. You can also share a document with others, and they’ll be able to then ask questions in the chatbot.</p><p> In our tests, we found Docalysis to be one of the best at analyzing documents and providing relevant answers. It understood simple chat prompts, was context-aware in a conversation, and the ability to see the file alongside was a great help.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-ChatPDF"><a href="#6-ChatPDF" class="headerlink" title="6.

In fact, in some apps, it’ll treat each question separately without using the previous query’s context. To get around this problem, try and learn how to use prompts for ChatGPT in the app you’re using. With a little trial and error, you will be able to figure out how to frame a question so that answers use the context of what you’ve chatted about before.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-ig-tunes-crafting-perfect-music-posts/"><u>[Updated] IG Tunes  Crafting Perfect Music Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-ways-to-fix-it-when-my-oppo-reno-9a-wont-charge-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Ways to Fix it When My Oppo Reno 9A Wont Charge | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimize-online-sessions-tackling-zoom-audio-noise/"><u>2024 Approved  Optimize Online Sessions  Tackling Zoom Audio Noise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perplexing-perspective-shifts-in-instagram-video-feeds/"><u>2024 Approved  Perplexing Perspective Shifts in Instagram Video Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-sync-contacts-from-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>4 Ways to Sync Contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/artificial-intelligence-in-the-written-word-7-insights/"><u>Artificial Intelligence in the Written Word: 7 Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/beware-ai-and-sensitive-data-dont-mix/"><u>Beware: AI and Sensitive Data Don't Mix</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/bringing-advanced-search-to-your-fingers-bings-ai-for-smartphones/"><u>Bringing Advanced Search to Your Fingers: Bing’s AI for Smartphones.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/chatgpt-enhanced-excel-streamlining-complex-tasks-and-processes/"><u>ChatGPT-Enhanced Excel: Streamlining Complex Tasks and Processes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/dialogue-dissection-gpt-vs-bingbots-10-key-dichotomies/"><u>Dialogue Dissection: GPT Vs.

So, what does the AI chatbot really know about you, and what is it using this information for?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Let’s take a look at its privacy policy and terms of service to find out what it knows and how much of a privacy risk it poses to you.</p><h2 id="What-Information-Does-ChatGPT-Store"><a href="#What-Information-Does-ChatGPT-Store" class="headerlink" title="What Information Does ChatGPT Store?"></a>What Information Does ChatGPT Store?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-privacy-issues-does-openai-keep-private-data.jpg"                      alt="A conversation with ChatGPT in which it says OpenAI keeps some personal data."                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" >ChatGPT’s privacy policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tells us almost everything we need to know about its data retention habits. It gathers its information from three sources:</p><ul><li>Account information that you enter when you sign up or pay for a premium plan.</li><li>Information that you type into the chatbot itself.</li><li>Identifying data it pulls from your device or browser, like your IP address and location.</li></ul><p> Most of the data that it keeps isn’t particularly alarming. In fact, it’s pretty standard—you could expect almost any site you have an account with to know these things about you.</p><p> The real risk is that it collects data from your conversations with ChatGPT. When you’re using the AI, it’s extremely easy to feed it your private information by mistake. All you need to do is forget to censor a document that you ask it to proofread, and you could be in real trouble.</p><h3 id="Your-Account-and-Billing-Information"><a href="#Your-Account-and-Billing-Information" class="headerlink" title="Your Account and Billing Information"></a>Your Account and Billing Information</h3><p> OpenAI stores your name, contact details, login credentials, payment information, and transaction records. It only keeps the latter if you sign up for a premium account. This information is basic, and you can expect almost any website with which you have an account to collect it from you.</p><p> If you email the company or reach out to its customer support, it records your name, email address, and the content of your message. Similarly, it records your social media contact details and any personal information you share if you leave a comment on its social pages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Your-Device-Information"><a href="#Your-Device-Information" class="headerlink" title="Your Device Information"></a>Your Device Information</h3><p> ChatGPT’s service garners some personal information automatically from your device and browser.

This means any information you put into the chat, including personal information, is logged. It’s easy to fall into the trap of accidentally giving ChatGPT your private details without realizing it until it’s too late, especially if you use it to proofread personal or professional documents.</p><p> Using ChatGPT for your work gets a little more dangerous because it will store confidential information that you type in about the company you work for, your employees, and your clients. For example, if you use it to collate feedback and organize it into a report, you might unknowingly give it your customers’ contact details.</p><p> The privacy policy states that if you intend to enter personal data into the chat, you need to provide the people involved with adequate privacy notices. You also need to obtain their consent, and be able to show OpenAI that you are processing this data within the law. Further, if you’re entering information defined as private <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gdpr/" >according to GDPR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you must contact OpenAI to execute its Data Processing Addendum.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Does-ChatGPT-Record-Your-Conversations"><a href="#Does-ChatGPT-Record-Your-Conversations" class="headerlink" title="Does ChatGPT Record Your Conversations?"></a>Does ChatGPT Record Your Conversations?</h2><p> Yes, ChatGPT records everything you type into it. Its privacy policy states that when you use ChatGPT, it may collect personal information from your messages, any files you upload, and any feedback you provide. That makes <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-chatgpt-safe-cybersecurity-risks-openai-chatbot/" >ChatGPT a cybersecurity risk too <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> It also states that your conversations may be reviewed by its AI trainers to improve the chat and train the system further. So, your personal data is not only compromised, but used for the advantage of OpenAI.</p><p> It should be noted, however, that OpenAI allows users to retain a degree of control over their privacy. This is mostly due to the changes the company made in April 2023, when it introduced a new feature to ChatGPT. This feature allows users to disable chat history easily, via the settings menu (<strong>Settings &gt; Data controls &gt; Chat history &amp; training</strong>).</p><p> In an <a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt" >OpenAI announcement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> made at the time, it was stated that, when chat history is disabled, the company only retains conversations for 30 days. After 30 days, the conversations are deleted permanently. Conversations are only reviewed when they need to be monitored for abuse and inappropriate behavior.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-Can-See-My-ChatGPT-Data"><a href="#Who-Can-See-My-ChatGPT-Data" class="headerlink" title="Who Can See My ChatGPT Data?"></a>Who Can See My ChatGPT Data?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-privacy-issues-who-can-see-our-conversations-1.jpg"                      alt="A conversation with ChatGPT in which it admits AI trainers can see our logs."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Your personal information is available to a surprising number of people and entities. In its privacy policy, OpenAI states that it shares this data with:</p><ul><li>Vendors and service providers.</li><li>Other businesses.</li><li>Affiliates.</li><li>Legal entities.</li><li>AI trainers who review your conversations.</li></ul><p> OpenAI gives very vague information about who it shares your data with, and for what reason. It says it may provide your personal information to vendors and service providers to assist in meeting business needs and performing certain functions. These providers include web hosting services, cloud services, other IT providers, event managers, email services, and analytics services.</p><p> Other parts are more straightforward. OpenAI will share your data with other businesses that it is involved with during transactions, reorganization, bankruptcy, or receivership. It may further share your data with law enforcement agencies in order to protect other users, the public, or itself against legal liability.</p><p> OpenAI claims it may disclose your information to companies with which it is affiliated too. It doesn’t say much more about this, other than that its affiliates must obey its privacy policy when handling your data.</p><p> And finally, OpenAI’s training staff will review your conversations and use them to improve the AI. They also ensure that what you’re saying in your chats complies with the company’s policies. If you enter personal information into the chatbot, the trainers can see it.</p><h2 id="Will-Regulatory-Pressure-Force-OpenAI-to-Take-Privacy-More-Seriously"><a href="#Will-Regulatory-Pressure-Force-OpenAI-to-Take-Privacy-More-Seriously" class="headerlink" title="Will Regulatory Pressure Force OpenAI to Take Privacy More Seriously?"></a>Will Regulatory Pressure Force OpenAI to Take Privacy More Seriously?</h2><p> In May 2023, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-has-italy-banned-chatgpt/" >Italy banned ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for allegedly violating the GDPR. The ban has since been lifted, but regulatory bodies around the world have put pressure on OpenAI, demanding more transparency and accountability.</p><p> In May that same year, the privacy authorities for Canada, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta agreed to investigate OpenAI to determine whether its flagship product gathers data in accordance with the law. In a <a class="link"   href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2023/an%5F230525-2/" >joint OPC statement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the agencies explained that they aim to investigate how and why ChatGPT gathers data, whether it respects its “obligations” in regard to transparency, and if it obtains “meaningful consent” from users.</p><p> And in July 2023, news broke that the United States was investigating OpenAI as well. Per <a class="link"   href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/" >The Washington Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe to determine if OpenAI violated existing consumer protection laws by gathering information from the internet, and also to investigate the claims that ChatGPT spreads “false, misleading, disparaging or harmful” information.</p><p> The FTC also asked OpenAI to explain the security incident that took place in March 2023, when a bug in the system allowed some users to see others’ chat history and payment information. In response, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a social media post that his company would work with the agency, but stressed that ChatGPT follows the law.</p><p> It’s more than likely that governments across the globe will launch similar investigations into ChatGPT in the future, and it remains to be seen if this will have an impact on OpenAI’s approach to user privacy.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Friend-or-Foe"><a href="#ChatGPT-Friend-or-Foe" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT: Friend or Foe?"></a>ChatGPT: Friend or Foe?</h2><p> ChatGPT and OpenAI collect a lot of information about you. Some of the data it collects, like your account details and device information, is pretty normal.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-EU’s-Digital-Strategy-Its-Influence-on-the-Development-of-AI-Systems-Such-as-ChatGPT"><a href="#The-EU’s-Digital-Strategy-Its-Influence-on-the-Development-of-AI-Systems-Such-as-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="The EU’s Digital Strategy &amp; Its Influence on the Development of AI Systems Such as ChatGPT"></a>The EU’s Digital Strategy &amp; Its Influence on the Development of AI Systems Such as ChatGPT</h2><p> As the application of AI becomes more prevalent in our modern world, governments are considering how AI should be regulated. One such proposal put forward by the European Union is the Artificial Intelligence Act. But how will the AI Act regulate artificial intelligence, what effects will it have, and why has it angered OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><h2 id="What-Is-the-EU-AI-Act"><a href="#What-Is-the-EU-AI-Act" class="headerlink" title="What Is the EU AI Act?"></a>What Is the EU AI Act?</h2><p> What’s first important to note here is that the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act has not yet been enforced. Rather, it is still being fleshed out and altered so the European Parliament can reach a consensus on the final product. However, this act may come into law in the near future, so it’s important to understand what it entails.</p><p> The EU AI Act is focused on regulating the development, release, and use of artificial intelligence within the EU. Once fully enacted, the EU AI Act will be the world’s first set of official regulations placed upon the AI industry.</p><p> In May 2023, a draft was adopted by the EU’s Internal Market Committee and the Civil Liberties Committee. The draft discussed the first set of rules in the AI Act, which garnered 84 votes for, seven votes against, and 12 abstentions. A <a class="link"   href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230505IPR84904/ai-act-a-step-closer-to-the-first-rules-on-artificial-intelligence" >European Parliament press release <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stated that the amended draft focuses on ensuring that “AI systems are overseen by people, are safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory, and environmentally friendly.”</p><p> As AI technology advances, governments, businesses, and individuals are concerned about how it will be used. Because <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/predictions-generative-ai-change-lives/" >AI has so much potential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and may one day become incredibly powerful, it’s no surprise that people have questions, and governments want to ensure development doesn’t get out of hand.</p><p> However, this AI act still has people talking. If enacted, the EU AI Act will have a big effect on AI development and use within the EU.</p><p> As stated in the <a class="link"   href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:e0649735-a372-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF" >European Commission’s AI Act proposal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the act aims to “ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values.” Additionally, the proposal focuses on “enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems.”</p><p> Furthermore, the act “lays down a solid risk methodology to define ‘high-risk’ AI systems that pose significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons.”</p><p> While the EU AI Act has several objectives, its main aim is to somewhat reign in AI. This will be done by assessing the risk levels of AI systems, ensuring they follow EU laws, and enforcing transparency requirements for AI systems.</p><h2 id="Who-Will-Be-Affected-by-the-EU-AI-Act"><a href="#Who-Will-Be-Affected-by-the-EU-AI-Act" class="headerlink" title="Who Will Be Affected by the EU AI Act?"></a>Who Will Be Affected by the EU AI Act?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/court-hammer-1.jpg"                      alt="wooden court hammer on white background"                ></p><p> While the EU AI Act is still in the works, there are concerns over how it will affect AI researchers, developers, and users within the EU.</p><p> On the <a class="link"   href="https://www.artificial-intelligence-act.com/" >official Artificial Intelligence Act website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a scope is laid out for the act, including:</p><ul><li>Providers putting AI systems into use.</li><li>Users of AI who are physically established or present in the EU.</li><li>Providers of AI present in a third country, where the system’s output is used within the EU.</li><li>AI system importers and distributors.</li><li>Representatives of AI providers within the EU.</li><li>Product manufacturers putting AI systems into use within the EU under their own name or trademark.</li></ul><p> Evidently, the scope is large, spanning the AI industry. Thousands of AI organizations may be affected by this act, including ChatGPT creator, OpenAI. This has led to contention between the EU and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In fact, Altman has threatened to pull OpenAI, and therefore ChatGPT, out of the EU because of it. So, why has he made such a striking statement?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-Sam-Altman-Threatening-to-Pull-ChatGPT-From-the-EU"><a href="#Why-Is-Sam-Altman-Threatening-to-Pull-ChatGPT-From-the-EU" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Sam Altman Threatening to Pull ChatGPT From the EU?"></a>Why Is Sam Altman Threatening to Pull ChatGPT From the EU?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sam-altman-1.jpg"                      alt="sam altman sitting on stage talking"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image Credit: TechCrunch&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/techcrunch/48838377432/in/" >Flickr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Sam Altman’s threat to leave the EU stems from how the European Parliament will choose to regulate ChatGPT. You’ve likely heard of or used the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/" >ChatGPT chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> already, as it’s become the world’s most popular AI-powered language processing tool. Today, millions of people use ChatGPT, but EU residents may see changes to how they can access and use this tool after the AI Act is implemented.</p><p> A particularly contentious part of the European Commission’s EU Act proposal is the transparency requirements that will be placed on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-vs-bert/" >GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tools. The act, if enforced, will require GPT tools to follow transparency rules. For example, a given GPT model would have to be designed so that it does not produce any illegal content. Additionally, GPT models would have to be clear about whether AI created the content.</p><p> Altman hasn’t outright stated that ChatGPT won’t comply with these rules. In fact, the CEO would like to cooperate, but only if it is technically possible for OpenAI. <a class="link"   href="https://time.com/6282325/sam-altman-openai-eu/" >Time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reports that Altman stated OpenAI would attempt to comply, but the company has criticized how the EU AI Act proposal is currently worded.</p><p> Interestingly, this threat came shortly after <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-openai-ceo-calling-for-more-ai-regulation/" >Altman advocated for further AI regulation within the US <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to mitigate the risks of AI development.

This means that everyone can access GPT-4-level intelligence without paying. You might wonder why you would want to keep paying $20 monthly when you can get it for free.</p><p> Well, here are some reasons you might want to keep your ChatGPT Plus sub.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-More-Access-to-GPT-4o"><a href="#1-More-Access-to-GPT-4o" class="headerlink" title="1 More Access to GPT-4o"></a>1 More Access to GPT-4o</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-21-at-1-13-53-pm.png"                      alt="GPT modes for for ChatGPT Plus"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-gpt-4o-works-is-it-free/" >GPT-4o <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-gpt-4o-works-is-it-free/" >is OpenAI’s latest flagship GPT model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which it states is twice as fast as GPT-4 Turbo and 50% cheaper (when using APIs). However, Free users are not granted unlimited access to GPT-4o. OpenAI provides Free users with “limited access to GPT-4o.”</p><p> GPT-4o is now ChatGPT’s default model, but Free users will be reverted to GPT-3.5 when it’s unavailable. As a Free user, your access to GPT-4o is not guaranteed and is subject to availability. The term “limited access” implies usage restrictions or reduced availability during peak times.</p><p> Regardless, one thing is for certain: ChatGPT Plus users will get up to five times more messages for GPT-4o. Furthermore, Plus users can send up to 80 messages every three hours. From that, we can infer that Free users would get about 16 messages per hour on a good day. It’s not bad, but it’s quite low if you’re a heavy user.</p><p> However, all of these message rates are the best you will get. As ChatGPT becomes the crutch for more businesses and individuals, usage and availability will likely decline (temporarily) in the near future. Based on this, you’d likely want a Plus subscription to insure against crowded conditions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo"><a href="#2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo" class="headerlink" title="2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo"></a>2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p> Benchmarks and tests revealed that GPT-4o may be faster, but GPT-4 Turbo seems more accurate in some categories. It’s difficult to confirm the criteria for this and how some of these tests have been executed, but some users have reported better results from GPT-4—especially in mathematical and programming problems. Even OpenAI admits this, and according to its text evaluation results, GPT-4T does better at DROP (​​Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs) tests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gpt-40-02_light.png"                      alt="gpt-40-02_light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If some arbitrary tests don’t convince you, consider the number of extra GPT-4 prompts you’ll get from a sub.

With DALL-E, you can enter any prompt, and the AI will attempt to create an image from your text. It’s pretty useful, and it’s easily half the reason why I keep my Plus subscription. Even with access to GPT-4o, Free users cannot generate images from text—all DALL-E capabilities are locked behind the subscription paywall.</p><p> We are uncertain how this will translate to Free users’ access to the GPT store, seeing as many custom GPTs rely on DALL-E. But it’s very likely going to be completely unavailable until you pay.</p><h2 id="5-Get-Early-Access-to-ChatGPT-Voice-Mode-and-the-ChatGPT-Desktop-App"><a href="#5-Get-Early-Access-to-ChatGPT-Voice-Mode-and-the-ChatGPT-Desktop-App" class="headerlink" title="5  Get Early Access to ChatGPT Voice Mode and the ChatGPT Desktop App"></a>5  Get Early Access to ChatGPT Voice Mode and the ChatGPT Desktop App</h2><p> OpenAI’s demo of GPT-4o made waves on the internet because of its realistic Voice Mode. Due to how quickly GPT-4o can understand words and context, none of that characteristic delay happens while the AI is “thinking,” making for fluid—humanlike—conversation. On top of that, you can essentially video call the AI while in Voice Mode, and it will understand visual cues and objects it sees (thanks to its vision capabilities).</p><p> This new Voice Mode is not yet generally available, but Plus users will receive it as an early access feature. If you want to use this technology before most people, you’ll need to keep your ChatGPT subscription up and running.</p><p> While OpenAI’s recent demo showed us that the feature will come with the Mac app, Voice Mode is only available now through the ChatGPT smartphone app. Features like this are why many consider the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-chatgpt-ios-app-is-better-than-website/" >ChatGPT iOS app better than the website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> OpenAI also introduced us to a ChatGPT desktop in its demo. That is undoubtedly one of the early access features paid users will enjoy, and is first coming to macOS users. There may be more cool features down the line that offer very good value propositions, and paying for Plus is the only way to be among those who use it.</p><h2 id="6-Full-Access-to-Advanced-Data-Analysis-File-Uploads-Vision-and-Web-Browsing"><a href="#6-Full-Access-to-Advanced-Data-Analysis-File-Uploads-Vision-and-Web-Browsing" class="headerlink" title="6  Full Access to Advanced Data Analysis, File Uploads, Vision, and Web Browsing"></a>6  Full Access to Advanced Data Analysis, File Uploads, Vision, and Web Browsing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-21-at-1-17-24-pm.png"                      alt="ChatGPT plans on its website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

That has now changed, and all of these are available to Free users but with more limits. The limits include fewer prompts, fewer file uploads, and lower priority access to these services during peak hours.</p><p> For some, this has disincentivized carrying on a Plus subscription. However, you will need a subscription if you’re a heavy ChatGPT user and rely on it to understand, parse, and analyze documents and photos. Granted, these are features that many don’t use very often, but if you fall within the minority, you might want to keep your Plus sub.</p><p> Also, having full access to web browsing is super useful. ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff, and web browsing helps bridge that knowledge gap by letting it search the web to find current information. If you use ChatGPT for tasks that require current information, you might get frustrated with a Free plan.</p><p> Frankly, all the reasons for getting a ChatGPT Plus subscription are subject to how much you use the AI. If you use it a lot, you’ll find yourself hitting the limits very often. It can be well worth the money if you can afford it and don’t mind beta-testing new OpenAI features.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-from-clicks-to-cash-elevating-exposure-economics/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  From Clicks to Cash  Elevating Exposure Economics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-firefox-recording-tools-and-extensions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Firefox Recording Tools & Extensions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-finding-free-christian-ringtone-sources/"><u>2024 Approved  Finding Free Christian Ringtone Sources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-command-expertise-select-online-mastery-series/"><u>AI Command Expertise: Select Online Mastery Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-showdown-gpt-vs-bing-top-ai-chat-companions/"><u>AI Showdown: GPT Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="OpenAI’s-ChatGPT-Decoded-for-Users"><a href="#OpenAI’s-ChatGPT-Decoded-for-Users" class="headerlink" title="OpenAI’s ChatGPT Decoded for Users"></a>OpenAI’s ChatGPT Decoded for Users</h2><p> Initially released in November 2022, ChatGPT gave many of us an intriguing glimpse into what a future with AI might look like. Perhaps one where we don’t need to fret over how to write an email to our boss or can call on an AI personal assistant to explain difficult concepts quickly and simply.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Besides being able to compose a work email, ChatGPT can give you feedback on your presentation, suggest an itinerary for a weekend away, or brainstorm new ideas when you’re out of mental energy. With ChatGPT, you type your request and hit enter to see a response appear before you in a matter of seconds.</p><p> Want to learn how to use ChatGPT? We’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT?"></a>What Is ChatGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/home-page-of-chatgpt-website-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="Home page of ChatGPT website october 2023"                ></p><p> ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot that can answer almost any question you have—just as if Google were a person you could have a casual conversation with.</p><p> ChatGPT is special because it doesn’t feel like you’re talking to a computer. It can converse in natural language and remember things you’ve asked before, and in the first of its kind, it can understand voice and images too. If you took a picture of the contents inside your refrigerator, for example, it could suggest something you might want to cook for dinner based on the ingredients you have.</p><p> Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT was trained on an enormous amount of data from the internet, which probably included troves of information from places like Wikipedia, blogs, how-to websites, and scientific articles. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-chatgpt-accessing-up-to-date-information-means/" >ChatGPT can now browse the web <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adding more power to an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Works"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Works" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Works"></a>How ChatGPT Works</h2><p> ChatGPT was trained using a mix of machine learning and human intervention, using a method called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p><p> In fact, the first stage of training involved humans playing the role of both a human user and an AI assistant having a conversation. This helped demonstrate responses that humans prefer and go towards building a large dataset to feed the model.</p><p> Next, a reward model needed to be created for reinforcement learning. To do this, human AI trainers once again stepped in, but this time, they were asked to rank several model answers by quality, further helping ChatGPT choose the best response.</p><p> All of this is to say humans had a hand in helping to train ChatGPT to achieve a higher level of accuracy in its answers, but also to make sure that it sounded natural to talk to.</p><p> Far from being perfect, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >there are many problems facing ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, from confidently stating wrong facts to being a weapon for disinformation. Make sure to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/protect-privacy-using-chatgpt-for-work/" >protect your privacy when using ChatGPT for work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and never include personal information.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-ChatGPT-Account"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-ChatGPT-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a ChatGPT Account"></a>How to Create a ChatGPT Account</h2><p> To access ChatGPT, you will need to create an account on the <a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" >OpenAI website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It will ask you for an email and phone number, plus the main reason you want to use OpenAI, whether for research, app development, or personal use. Once signed up, head back to <a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get started, and log in to your ChatGPT account.</p><p> You can also use your OpenAI account to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/" >generate images from text using DALL-E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, another AI model developed by OpenAI.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-to-Use-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Use ChatGPT"></a>How to Use ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chatgpt-interface-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT interface October 2023"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

After the ChatGPT login page, like an ordinary messaging app, you type in the text box and hit enter or click the send button (paper airplane symbol).</p><p> Responses are generated quite fast, appearing directly underneath your question. Any follow-up questions will be added to the conversation thread, which you can look back on at any time.</p><p> Conversations are saved and stored in a panel on the left. If you want to start a fresh conversation, click the <strong>trash can icon</strong> beside the conversation heading to delete the thread, or press the <strong>New Chat</strong> button to start a new one.</p><p> ChatGPT is optimized for dialogue, so you don’t need to type out full sentences each time you have a follow-up question. You can try asking ChatGPT to summarize an answer or paraphrase a response if it doesn’t seem to answer your question well at first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-to-summarize-a-response.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to summarize a response"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-leads-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Ask-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-to-Ask-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What to Ask ChatGPT"></a>What to Ask ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-for-a-few-iconic-places-to-visit-in-nyc.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT for a few iconic places to visit in NYC"                ></p><p> Many people turn to Google when they want to ask how something works, but sifting through a website takes time. Instead of putting that question to the internet, you can use ChatGPT to get a quick and straightforward answer.</p><p> Not to mention, there’s the added benefit of having no annoying ads. You can also ask ChatGPT to present the information in the best way for you, for example, as a bullet point list instead of a paragraph. And if the answer is going way over your head, request the info to be simplified for better understanding.</p><p> There are plenty of interesting <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Take ChatGPTs answers with a grain of salt, and always do further research if you plan to use the info in a high-risk application.</p><p> Avoid using ChatGPT for medical advice, and don’t ask it for investment tips.

For example, if you ask ChatGPT what the best way to bully someone online is, it will decline to answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-how-to-bully-someone.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT how to bully someone"                ></p><p> This moderation isn’t perfect, and people are finding ways to get around the restrictions all the time.

The ability to ask follow-up questions means you can get to the information you are looking for much faster than crawling through the internet.</p><p> That doesn’t mean it’s perfect, though.

For low-risk tasks, it can really give us a hand but don’t blindly trust it for big decisions or serious endeavors.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Besides being able to compose a work email, ChatGPT can give you feedback on your presentation, suggest an itinerary for a weekend away, or brainstorm new ideas when you’re out of mental energy.

Google Translate: Which Is Better At Translation?"></a>ChatGPT Vs. Google Translate: Which Is Better At Translation?</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>ChatGPT has the potential to challenge Google Translate’s dominance in machine translation due to its ability to provide interpretations of idioms, preserving meaning and intent.</li><li>Both Google Translate and ChatGPT have their strengths and weaknesses in general translation accuracy, with ChatGPT getting closer to the nuance of the message in some cases.</li><li>While Google Translate covers more languages, the translations provided by ChatGPT for unsupported languages may be inconsistent in terms of accuracy. Both tools are free for users to experiment with.</li></ul><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> From content writing and programming to product design and data analysis, ChatGPT is immediately impacting almost every digital field imaginable.</p><p> However, one area in which ChatGPT could be particularly impactful is machine translation. Currently, Google Translate is the top dog, and almost everyone else is playing catch-up.</p><p> But with the rise of ChatGPT, could Google Translate’s dominance be challenged? We’ll pit ChatGPT against Google Translate to see which tool can provide better translations.</p><h2 id="What-Does-a-Good-Translation-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-a-Good-Translation-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does a Good Translation Look Like?"></a>What Does a Good Translation Look Like?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/ff0b61be790a55820d60db4c7ad60b6e5b6b95574b036e27c98e637af2bd24e8.jpg"                      alt="A Translate keyboard button"                ></p><p> The primary purpose of translation is to convey the meaning of a speech written or spoken in one language using another language. Consequently, a good translation must not just swap the meaning of words between two languages but must convey the meaning of the entire body of text as a whole.</p><p> It must also not just be a literal meaning of a speech but must communicate the meaning intended by the user while preserving the tone, cultural connotation, and context.</p><p> Unfortunately, a good translation is hard, even from big translation services like Google Translate. Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right. One statement may mean one thing in one context and a different thing in another context.</p><p> Similarly, colloquialisms that involve proverbs, idioms, and wordplay can be problematic to translate.</p><p> Since text translation is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things ChatGPT can do impressively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we decided to compare how it stacks up against Google Translate. We selected some hard-to-translate text that featured common translation problems to compare the two tools.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms</h2><p> When translating colloquialisms, the translation may not preserve the meaning and intent in a similar tone as the original language.</p><p> We asked Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate the simple English idiom “Juan kicked the bucket” to Spanish. Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating.

Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate.

Consequently, a good translation must not just swap the meaning of words between two languages but must convey the meaning of the entire body of text as a whole.</p><p> It must also not just be a literal meaning of a speech but must communicate the meaning intended by the user while preserving the tone, cultural connotation, and context.</p><p> Unfortunately, a good translation is hard, even from big translation services like Google Translate. Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right. One statement may mean one thing in one context and a different thing in another context.</p><p> Similarly, colloquialisms that involve proverbs, idioms, and wordplay can be problematic to translate.</p><p> Since text translation is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things ChatGPT can do impressively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we decided to compare how it stacks up against Google Translate.

Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating.

Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool.

However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate.

Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right.

Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help.

Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate. While ChatGPT covers more languages, the translations it provides for many of them leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-2"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-2" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?</h2><p> It’s hard to say with certainty.

However, ChatGPT, although relatively new, is not a pushover. One of ChatGPT’s greatest advantages is its ability to adjust its translation based on the context or extra provided by the user. Google Translate can not currently do this.</p><p> While we can’t confidently say whether ChatGPT will challenge Google Translate’s dominance as the preferred translation tool, the AI chatbot clearly has the potential to give Google a fight.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> From content writing and programming to product design and data analysis, ChatGPT is immediately impacting almost every digital field imaginable.</p><p> However, one area in which ChatGPT could be particularly impactful is machine translation.

We’ll pit ChatGPT against Google Translate to see which tool can provide better translations.</p><h2 id="What-Does-a-Good-Translation-Look-Like-3"><a href="#What-Does-a-Good-Translation-Look-Like-3" class="headerlink" title="What Does a Good Translation Look Like?"></a>What Does a Good Translation Look Like?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/ff0b61be790a55820d60db4c7ad60b6e5b6b95574b036e27c98e637af2bd24e8.jpg"                      alt="A Translate keyboard button"                ></p><p> The primary purpose of translation is to convey the meaning of a speech written or spoken in one language using another language. Consequently, a good translation must not just swap the meaning of words between two languages but must convey the meaning of the entire body of text as a whole.</p><p> It must also not just be a literal meaning of a speech but must communicate the meaning intended by the user while preserving the tone, cultural connotation, and context.</p><p> Unfortunately, a good translation is hard, even from big translation services like Google Translate. Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right. One statement may mean one thing in one context and a different thing in another context.</p><p> Similarly, colloquialisms that involve proverbs, idioms, and wordplay can be problematic to translate.</p><p> Since text translation is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things ChatGPT can do impressively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we decided to compare how it stacks up against Google Translate. We selected some hard-to-translate text that featured common translation problems to compare the two tools.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms</h2><p> When translating colloquialisms, the translation may not preserve the meaning and intent in a similar tone as the original language.</p><p> We asked Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate the simple English idiom “Juan kicked the bucket” to Spanish. Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating. In this case, ChatGPT will provide a literal translation and interpretation of the idiom.</p><p> We tried several other colloquialisms, and both services almost always provided a literal translation. While this works, it could provide misleading information in some situations. ChatGPT’s ability to provide an “interpretation” rather than just a literal translation of colloquialism is an advantage.</p><p> But one task is insufficient to draw conclusions, so we increased the heat, this time using a Filipino idiom.</p><p> “Sa gitna ng kagutumang buto’t balat at butas na bulsang kahirapan, mataba ang lupa para sa pagtatagumpay ng anakpawis”</p><p> The closest native translation of the source text should be: “Amid emaciating hunger and extreme poverty, the grounds are fertile for the victory of the toiling masses.”</p><p> ChatGPT had a go at it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chatgpt-translate-filipino2.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT tries to translate a Filipino idiomatic expression"                ></p><p> And so did Google:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-translates-filipino2.jpg"                      alt="Google translates a Filipino idiomatic expression"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This clearly gave both tools a hard time, but Google Translate seemed to have an edge.</p><p> Of course, things were made even harder, this time switching to the Malayalam language.

No difference in translation.</p><p> Up next is a translation task in Filipino.</p><p> Ang gamot sa topaking babae ay ang lambing ng isang maunawaing lalaki</p><p> The source text is a bit of a complex wordplay: “The cure for a girl who acts up is the sweetness of an understanding man.”</p><p> Google turned up: “The medicine for a woman is the tenderness of an understanding man.” So it wasn’t a complete disaster, but it didn’t get the nuance of the message right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-translates-filipino.jpg"                      alt="Google translates filipino text"                ></p><p> ChatGPT, on the other hand, turned up: “The cure for a heartbroken woman is the affection of an understanding man.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chatgpt-translate-filipino.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT translate filipino"                ></p><p> None of the translations are particularly perfect, but ChatGPT got as close as possible.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Creoles-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Creoles-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Creoles"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Creoles</h2><p> Creoles, especially those that borrow many words from other languages, are notoriously hard to translate. We tasked both ChatGPT and Google Translate to interpret a creole called “Pidgin English,” spoken in West Africa.</p><p> Below is the source text:</p><p> “Wetin come happen na. Since you say you go come help me with that thing, I no come see your brake light. Wetin sup?”</p><p> In the source text, the speaker is complaining to the reader that they promised to help with a task but haven’t turned up since then. Then, it concludes with “What’s happening?”</p><p> While Google Translate understands “Pidgin English ‘’ to some extent, it failed woefully at translating the source text. Part of the problem is due to Google Translate’s limited ability to distinguish Creole from English because of the presence of English words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-translate-pidgin-translation.jpg"                      alt="Google Translate Pidgin Translation"                ></p><p> Although not flawlessly, ChatGPT’s interpretation was able to clearly convey the meaning and intent of the speaker. Considering the highly contextual nature of Pidgin English, the results are very impressive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-pidgin-translation.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Pidgin Translation"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Language-Coverage-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Language-Coverage-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Language Coverage"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Language Coverage</h2><p> Comparing the language coverage between ChatGPT and Google Translate is a bit tricky. Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate. While ChatGPT covers more languages, the translations it provides for many of them leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?</h2><p> It’s hard to say with certainty. Both translation tools have their strong points. Google has been making massive investments in <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/" >Natural Language Processing (NLP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As a result, it outperforms ChatGPT in languages to which it has paid special attention. However, considering <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works and its training <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it represents a unique and exciting approach to translation. Which of them should you use? Both tools are free, so feel free to experiment and settle for which one works for you.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-An-Emerging-Translation-Tool-3"><a href="#ChatGPT-An-Emerging-Translation-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT: An Emerging Translation Tool"></a>ChatGPT: An Emerging Translation Tool</h2><p> Google Translate has made a name for itself in the machine translation space. However, ChatGPT, although relatively new, is not a pushover. One of ChatGPT’s greatest advantages is its ability to adjust its translation based on the context or extra provided by the user. Google Translate can not currently do this.</p><p> While we can’t confidently say whether ChatGPT will challenge Google Translate’s dominance as the preferred translation tool, the AI chatbot clearly has the potential to give Google a fight.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-guide-to-mounting-a-tripod-for-vloggers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Essential Guide to Mounting a Tripod for Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pinpointing-personalities-pinning-friends-on-snapchat/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pinpointing Personalities  Pinning Friends on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-techniques-for-pace-modification-on-snapchat-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling Techniques for Pace Modification on Snapchat Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-twitter-visionaries-the-highest-viewed-tweets/"><u>[New] Twitter Visionaries  The Highest-Viewed Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-full-facetune-review-the-pathway-to-picture-perfection/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Full Facetune Review  The Pathway to Picture Perfection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-smooth-screen-sharing-on-skype-while-working-from-home/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tips for Smooth Screen Sharing on Skype While Working From Home</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-streamline-your-screen-time-step-by-step-towards-a-well-curated-playlist/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Screen Time  Step-by-Step Towards a Well-Curated Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-free-srt-conversion-uncover-top-8-online-options/"><u>2024 Approved  Free SRT Conversion  Uncover Top 8 Online Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-method-for-producing-captivating-video-thumbnails/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Method for Producing Captivating Video Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transforming-youtube-content-using-the-power-of-imovie/"><u>2024 Approved  Transforming YouTube Content Using the Power of iMovie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-the-power-of-sony-vegas-to-enhance-your-youtube-channel/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock the Power of Sony Vegas to Enhance Your YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-growth-fueling-a-new-wave-of-security-threats/"><u>AI Growth: Fueling a New Wave of Security Threats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-triumph-comparing-the-supremacy-of-gemini-and-plus-chatgpt/"><u>AI Triumph: Comparing the Supremacy of Gemini and Plus-ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-your-partner-in-pushing-boundaries-of-content/"><u>AI: Your Partner in Pushing Boundaries of Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/become-a-master-chef-with-7-helpful-gpt-powered-tips/"><u>Become a Master Chef with 7 Helpful GPT-Powered Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-asus-by-drfone-android/"><u>Bypassing Google Account With vnROM Bypass For Asus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/chatgpt-at-your-service-6-innovations-revolutionizing-smartwatch-tech/"><u>ChatGPT at Your Service: 6 Innovations Revolutionizing Smartwatch Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/chatgpt-max-char-count-and-workarounds/"><u>ChatGPT: Max Char Count & Workarounds?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/clarity-in-functionality-gpt4all-explored/"><u>Clarity in Functionality: GPT4All Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/confronting-ai-titans-advanced-gemini-vs-plush-gpt/"><u>Confronting AI Titans: Advanced Gemini Vs.

Whether you need help finding a job, completing a project at work, planning an event, or simply need someone to talk to, ChatGPT can come in handy.</p><p> Unfortunately, it can be frustrating to type out everything you need ChatGPT to do over and over again. So, to save you the stress of typing out long ChatGPT prompts, we’ve put together five ways you can control ChatGPT with your voice.</p><h2 id="1-Using-the-ChatGPT-Mobile-App"><a href="#1-Using-the-ChatGPT-Mobile-App" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is available for both Android and iOS and is quite easy to use. To control ChatGPT using your voice from the mobile app:</p><ol><li>Install the app and sign in.</li><li>Tap the mic button (displays as a sound wave icon on iPhone) on the text input area where you’d normally type your text prompt to start recording.</li><li>Speak your prompt aloud.</li><li>Once you have finished speaking, tap the area that reads <strong>Tap to stop recording</strong>. This will tell ChatGPT to stop recording and start transcribing your voice recording into text.</li><li>After the transcription is complete, review the text to make sure it accurately captured what you said.</li><li>Tap the send button to submit the transcribed text as your prompt to ChatGPT.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2023-09-26-06-32-12-044_com-openai-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Controlling ChatGPT with your voice using the mobile app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2023-09-26-06-33-26-153_com-openai-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Controlling ChatGPT with your voice using the mobile app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_2023-09-26-06-32-55-011_com-openai-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Controlling ChatGPT with your voice using the mobile app"                ></p><p>Close</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> ChatGPT for <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2024483/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&hl=en&gl=US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> | <a class="link"   href="http://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><p> It’s worth noting that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-new-voice-response-function-launched/" >OpenAI is giving ChatGPT a voice to respond to your prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There are dozens of languages on offer, and it transcribes text with impressive speed.</p><h3 id="VoiceWave-ChatGPT-Voice-Control-2"><a href="#VoiceWave-ChatGPT-Voice-Control-2" class="headerlink" title="VoiceWave - ChatGPT Voice Control"></a>VoiceWave - ChatGPT Voice Control</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/voice-wave-chrome-extension-for-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="voice wave chrome extension for chatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> VoiceWave is purpose-built for ChatGPT and comes with many customization features you’ll find handy. For example, you can issue voice commands in dozens of languages, and VoiceWave will automatically transcribe them to text right inside the ChatGPT prompt input box.</p><p> Recording with the tool is quite easy. Once you’ve installed and activated the Chrome extension, a small microphone icon sits next to your ChatGPT prompt input box every time you visit the ChatGPT website. Clicking the microphone icon activates the speech-to-text feature, activates your computer’s microphone, and listens to your voice commands for transcription.</p><h3 id="Talk-to-ChatGPT-3"><a href="#Talk-to-ChatGPT-3" class="headerlink" title="Talk-to-ChatGPT"></a>Talk-to-ChatGPT</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/talk-to-chatgpt-chrome-extension.jpg"                      alt="talk-to-chatgpt chrome extension"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Although not entirely the best in design and accessibility, Talk-to-ChatGPT is one of the most widely used extensions for issuing voice commands to ChatGPT. It supports most major languages and comes with many customization features you’ll find useful.</p><p> Once installed and activated, the Talk-to-ChatGPT Chrome extension adds a small rectangular box in the top right corner of your screen. The box contains controls for toggling on and off voice typing. Apart from issuing voice commands, you can also get the tool to read out ChatGPT’s responses using different AI voices.</p><h3 id="Voice-Control-for-ChatGPT-3"><a href="#Voice-Control-for-ChatGPT-3" class="headerlink" title="Voice Control for ChatGPT"></a>Voice Control for ChatGPT</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/voice-control-for-chatgpt-chrome-extension.jpg"                      alt="voice control for ChatGPT chrome extension"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Voice Control for ChatGPT is exactly what the name says—it gives you the ability to prompt ChatGPT with voice commands while it reads back the responses if you prefer. Once installed and activated, the Chrome extension adds several buttons just below the ChatGPT prompt text box, which you can use to control your voice interaction with ChatGPT.</p><p> Unlike Talk-to-ChatGPT and VoiceWave, editing out mistakes or mistranscribed words is a bit complex since the text is not directly injected into ChatGPT’s prompt text box. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s an excellent speech-to-text tool nonetheless.</p><h2 id="Will-ChatGPT-Get-An-Official-Audio-Input-Feature-3"><a href="#Will-ChatGPT-Get-An-Official-Audio-Input-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="Will ChatGPT Get An Official Audio Input Feature?"></a>Will ChatGPT Get An Official Audio Input Feature?</h2><p> Despite popular demand for a voice input feature, OpenAI has kept its ChatGPT interface as basic as possible. While the clutter-free design is appealing to many users, ChatGPT might benefit from an inbuilt voice input feature, especially considering how frequently people use the app.</p><p> But the big question is, is OpenAI interested in adding such a feature to ChatGPT? While we wait to see whether such a feature will come to life, use the methods we’ve shared above to issue voice commands to ChatGPT.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-windows-10-storage-guide-how-to-save-and-organize-mov/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Windows 10 Storage Guide  How to Save and Organize .mov</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-ideal-selection-8-must-have-image-packs-for-laptops/"><u>[New] Ideal Selection  8 Must-Have Image Packs for Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-minecraft-ultimate-recording-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Minecraft  Ultimate Recording Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-premium-cloud-services-on-android-the-ultimate-2024-compilation/"><u>[New] Premium Cloud Services on Android  The Ultimate 2024 Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-breaking-into-the-digital-age-mobile-streaming-on-facebook/"><u>[Updated] Breaking Into the Digital Age  Mobile Streaming on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-7-essential-free-audio-tracks-for-youtubers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover 7 Essential Free Audio Tracks for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-leading-platforms-mimicking-twitters-network-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Leading Platforms Mimicking Twitter's Network for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-supercharge-your-task-management-with-top-8-chrome-plug-ins/"><u>AI Supercharge Your Task Management with Top 8 Chrome Plug-Ins</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/assessing-chatgpts-safety-measures-and-risks/"><u>Assessing ChatGPT’s Safety Measures and Risks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/beyond-binary-bonds-are-machines-learning-to-feel-with-us/"><u>Beyond Binary Bonds: Are Machines Learning to Feel with Us?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/craft-engaging-sites-with-chatgpts-creative-four-ways/"><u>Craft Engaging Sites with ChatGPT’s Creative Four Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/create-free-on-premise-windows-gpt-emulation/"><u>Create Free, On-Premise Windows GPT Emulation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/current-methods-incorporating-gpt-4-with-chatgpt/"><u>Current Methods: Incorporating GPT-4 with ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/daily-dharma-with-technology-cultivating-zen-through-gpt/"><u>Daily Dharma with Technology: Cultivating Zen Through GPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/decoding-truthgpt-innovation-by-tesla-boss/"><u>Decoding TruthGPT: Innovation by Tesla Boss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/dynamic-interactions-chatgpt-meets-crypto-world/"><u>Dynamic Interactions: ChatGPT Meets Crypto World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/exploring-the-advantages-choose-claude-3-over-chatgpt-for-better-results/"><u>Exploring the Advantages: Choose Claude 3 Over ChatGPT for Better Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/exploring-the-legal-aspects-of-youtube-content-capture/"><u>Exploring the Legal Aspects of YouTube Content Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-infinix-note-30-pro-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Infinix Note 30 Pro to Other Android Devices?

Both tools are free for users to experiment with.</li></ul><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> From content writing and programming to product design and data analysis, ChatGPT is immediately impacting almost every digital field imaginable.</p><p> However, one area in which ChatGPT could be particularly impactful is machine translation. Currently, Google Translate is the top dog, and almost everyone else is playing catch-up.</p><p> But with the rise of ChatGPT, could Google Translate’s dominance be challenged? We’ll pit ChatGPT against Google Translate to see which tool can provide better translations.</p><h2 id="What-Does-a-Good-Translation-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-a-Good-Translation-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does a Good Translation Look Like?"></a>What Does a Good Translation Look Like?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/ff0b61be790a55820d60db4c7ad60b6e5b6b95574b036e27c98e637af2bd24e8.jpg"                      alt="A Translate keyboard button"                ></p><p> The primary purpose of translation is to convey the meaning of a speech written or spoken in one language using another language. Consequently, a good translation must not just swap the meaning of words between two languages but must convey the meaning of the entire body of text as a whole.</p><p> It must also not just be a literal meaning of a speech but must communicate the meaning intended by the user while preserving the tone, cultural connotation, and context.</p><p> Unfortunately, a good translation is hard, even from big translation services like Google Translate. Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right. One statement may mean one thing in one context and a different thing in another context.</p><p> Similarly, colloquialisms that involve proverbs, idioms, and wordplay can be problematic to translate.</p><p> Since text translation is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things ChatGPT can do impressively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we decided to compare how it stacks up against Google Translate. We selected some hard-to-translate text that featured common translation problems to compare the two tools.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms</h2><p> When translating colloquialisms, the translation may not preserve the meaning and intent in a similar tone as the original language.</p><p> We asked Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate the simple English idiom “Juan kicked the bucket” to Spanish. Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating. In this case, ChatGPT will provide a literal translation and interpretation of the idiom.</p><p> We tried several other colloquialisms, and both services almost always provided a literal translation. While this works, it could provide misleading information in some situations.

This is a close contest. While Google Translate has an edge, ChatGPT can provide the meaning of idioms instead of just translations.

Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate. While ChatGPT covers more languages, the translations it provides for many of them leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?</h2><p> It’s hard to say with certainty.

Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism.

Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating. In this case, ChatGPT will provide a literal translation and interpretation of the idiom.</p><p> We tried several other colloquialisms, and both services almost always provided a literal translation.

Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate. While ChatGPT covers more languages, the translations it provides for many of them leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-1"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-1" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?</h2><p> It’s hard to say with certainty.

Consequently, a good translation must not just swap the meaning of words between two languages but must convey the meaning of the entire body of text as a whole.</p><p> It must also not just be a literal meaning of a speech but must communicate the meaning intended by the user while preserving the tone, cultural connotation, and context.</p><p> Unfortunately, a good translation is hard, even from big translation services like Google Translate. Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right. One statement may mean one thing in one context and a different thing in another context.</p><p> Similarly, colloquialisms that involve proverbs, idioms, and wordplay can be problematic to translate.</p><p> Since text translation is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things ChatGPT can do impressively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we decided to compare how it stacks up against Google Translate.

Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating. In this case, ChatGPT will provide a literal translation and interpretation of the idiom.</p><p> We tried several other colloquialisms, and both services almost always provided a literal translation.

We tasked both ChatGPT and Google Translate to interpret a creole called “Pidgin English,” spoken in West Africa.</p><p> Below is the source text:</p><p> “Wetin come happen na. Since you say you go come help me with that thing, I no come see your brake light. Wetin sup?”</p><p> In the source text, the speaker is complaining to the reader that they promised to help with a task but haven’t turned up since then. Then, it concludes with “What’s happening?”</p><p> While Google Translate understands “Pidgin English ‘’ to some extent, it failed woefully at translating the source text. Part of the problem is due to Google Translate’s limited ability to distinguish Creole from English because of the presence of English words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-translate-pidgin-translation.jpg"                      alt="Google Translate Pidgin Translation"                ></p><p> Although not flawlessly, ChatGPT’s interpretation was able to clearly convey the meaning and intent of the speaker.

Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate. While ChatGPT covers more languages, the translations it provides for many of them leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-2"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-2" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?</h2><p> It’s hard to say with certainty.

Consequently, a good translation must not just swap the meaning of words between two languages but must convey the meaning of the entire body of text as a whole.</p><p> It must also not just be a literal meaning of a speech but must communicate the meaning intended by the user while preserving the tone, cultural connotation, and context.</p><p> Unfortunately, a good translation is hard, even from big translation services like Google Translate. Machine translation is tough because languages aren’t the same in their approach to constructing sentences. For example, in a language like French, pronouns have a gender, while in Japanese, pronouns are almost completely omitted. Similarly, in Chinese, there are barely any differences between singular or plural nouns. In English, the reverse is the case.</p><p> This all adds up to present unique challenges when translating between pairs of languages.</p><p> And then there’s the issue of context and colloquialism. Machine translation tools find it hard to get the context of a statement right. One statement may mean one thing in one context and a different thing in another context.</p><p> Similarly, colloquialisms that involve proverbs, idioms, and wordplay can be problematic to translate.</p><p> Since text translation is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things ChatGPT can do impressively <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we decided to compare how it stacks up against Google Translate. We selected some hard-to-translate text that featured common translation problems to compare the two tools.</p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Colloquialisms-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Colloquialisms</h2><p> When translating colloquialisms, the translation may not preserve the meaning and intent in a similar tone as the original language.</p><p> We asked Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate the simple English idiom “Juan kicked the bucket” to Spanish. Both translation services produced “Juan pateó el balde,” a literal translation of the idiom. While this works, the meaning or intent would be completely lost for someone who doesn’t understand the context.</p><p> Here, Google Translate’s ability to help ends. However, ChatGPT offers more help. Rather than simply prompting it to translate, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a “meaning in Spanish” or “provide a meaning in English,” depending on which language you are translating. In this case, ChatGPT will provide a literal translation and interpretation of the idiom.</p><p> We tried several other colloquialisms, and both services almost always provided a literal translation. While this works, it could provide misleading information in some situations. ChatGPT’s ability to provide an “interpretation” rather than just a literal translation of colloquialism is an advantage.</p><p> But one task is insufficient to draw conclusions, so we increased the heat, this time using a Filipino idiom.</p><p> “Sa gitna ng kagutumang buto’t balat at butas na bulsang kahirapan, mataba ang lupa para sa pagtatagumpay ng anakpawis”</p><p> The closest native translation of the source text should be: “Amid emaciating hunger and extreme poverty, the grounds are fertile for the victory of the toiling masses.”</p><p> ChatGPT had a go at it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chatgpt-translate-filipino2.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT tries to translate a Filipino idiomatic expression"                ></p><p> And so did Google:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-translates-filipino2.jpg"                      alt="Google translates a Filipino idiomatic expression"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This clearly gave both tools a hard time, but Google Translate seemed to have an edge.</p><p> Of course, things were made even harder, this time switching to the Malayalam language.

No difference in translation.</p><p> Up next is a translation task in Filipino.</p><p> Ang gamot sa topaking babae ay ang lambing ng isang maunawaing lalaki</p><p> The source text is a bit of a complex wordplay: “The cure for a girl who acts up is the sweetness of an understanding man.”</p><p> Google turned up: “The medicine for a woman is the tenderness of an understanding man.” So it wasn’t a complete disaster, but it didn’t get the nuance of the message right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-translates-filipino.jpg"                      alt="Google translates filipino text"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ChatGPT, on the other hand, turned up: “The cure for a heartbroken woman is the affection of an understanding man.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chatgpt-translate-filipino.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT translate filipino"                ></p><p> None of the translations are particularly perfect, but ChatGPT got as close as possible.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Creoles-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Translating-Creoles-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Creoles"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Translating Creoles</h2><p> Creoles, especially those that borrow many words from other languages, are notoriously hard to translate. We tasked both ChatGPT and Google Translate to interpret a creole called “Pidgin English,” spoken in West Africa.</p><p> Below is the source text:</p><p> “Wetin come happen na. Since you say you go come help me with that thing, I no come see your brake light. Wetin sup?”</p><p> In the source text, the speaker is complaining to the reader that they promised to help with a task but haven’t turned up since then. Then, it concludes with “What’s happening?”</p><p> While Google Translate understands “Pidgin English ‘’ to some extent, it failed woefully at translating the source text. Part of the problem is due to Google Translate’s limited ability to distinguish Creole from English because of the presence of English words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-translate-pidgin-translation.jpg"                      alt="Google Translate Pidgin Translation"                ></p><p> Although not flawlessly, ChatGPT’s interpretation was able to clearly convey the meaning and intent of the speaker. Considering the highly contextual nature of Pidgin English, the results are very impressive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-pidgin-translation.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Pidgin Translation"                ></p><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Language-Coverage-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Language-Coverage-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Language Coverage"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Language Coverage</h2><p> Comparing the language coverage between ChatGPT and Google Translate is a bit tricky. Google Translate covers more than 140 languages, and that number keeps growing. This is because Google regularly adds new languages to the Google Translate tool. For ChatGPT, on the other hand, there are no official numbers regarding how many languages the tool can cover. However, based on how ChatGPT was trained, there’s a logical basis to suspect that the coverage is significantly more than ChatGPT.</p><p> Of course, we tested ChatGPT on several languages not supported by Google Translate. It was able to provide translations for these additional languages, which Google Translate does not offer. However, the quality of ChatGPT’s translations for these unsupported languages was a bit inconsistent. While some were considerably accurate, some were quite poor and inaccurate. While ChatGPT covers more languages, the translations it provides for many of them leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-3"><a href="#Google-Translate-vs-ChatGPT-Which-Translation-Tool-Is-Better-3" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?"></a>Google Translate vs. ChatGPT: Which Translation Tool Is Better?</h2><p> It’s hard to say with certainty.

In addition to ChatGPT, DALL-E, Point-E, and other successful tools, OpenAI has released Shap-E, a new innovative model.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So what is OpenAI’s Shap-E, and what can it do for you?</p><h2 id="What-Is-OpenAI’s-Shap-E"><a href="#What-Is-OpenAI’s-Shap-E" class="headerlink" title="What Is OpenAI’s Shap-E?"></a>What Is OpenAI’s Shap-E?</h2><p> In May 2023, Alex Nichol and Heewon Jun, OpenAI researchers and contributors, released a <a class="link"   href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463" >paper announcing Shap-E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the company’s latest innovation. Shap-E is a new tool trained on a massive dataset of paired 3D images and text that can generate 3D models from text or images. It is similar to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/" >DALL-E, which can create 2D images from text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but Shap-E produces 3D assets.</p><p> Shap-E is trained on a conditional diffusion model and 3D asset mapping. Mapping 3D assets means that Shap-E learns to associate text or images with corresponding 3D models from a large dataset of existing 3D objects.

Tap on your shortcut, and you will be prompted to allow the shortcut to connect to OpenAI. Press <strong>Allow</strong> to give it the necessary permissions. If any of the shortcuts give you additional prompts, like asking you to allow access to <strong>Speech Recognition</strong> or <strong>Enable Diction</strong>, make sure you tap <strong>Allow</strong>.</p><p> Once this is done, you are free to use your shortcuts with Siri, and it’s just as easy as giving Siri any other command. All you have to do is say, “Hey Siri, launch SiriGPT” or “Hey Siri, launch ChatGPT 1.2.4,” depending on what shortcut you’ve downloaded, and the chatbot will instantly be at your service.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Instantaneously-Deploying-Smart-Agents-Online-via-AgentGPT"><a href="#Instantaneously-Deploying-Smart-Agents-Online-via-AgentGPT" class="headerlink" title="Instantaneously Deploying Smart Agents Online via AgentGPT"></a>Instantaneously Deploying Smart Agents Online via AgentGPT</h2><p> Looking for an AI assistant to help you accomplish tasks? AgentGPT can assist you with your goals just by using your web browser! Unlike autonomous AI assistants like Auto-GPT, AgentGPT requires no download or installation. Instead, you go to their website, create an account (or not), and harness the power of autonomous GPT.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Of course, there are a few things you need to learn before you start. So, if this is relatively new to you and you would like to know more about AgentGPT, how to use it, how it works, and its limitations, you’re in the right place.</p><h2 id="What-Is-AgentGPT"><a href="#What-Is-AgentGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is AgentGPT?"></a>What Is AgentGPT?</h2><p> AgentGPT is an AI platform that makes AI agents that cater to your goals. The goals can be anything that you desire. Whether developing a marketing strategy, building a website, or creating content, AgentGPT will do its best to help accomplish your goals.</p><p> It is an open-source project that utilizes OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models. Although similar to ChatGPT, AgentGPT can autonomously create its own tasks, search the internet, and even deploy new agents to accomplish its given goal.</p><p> With AgentGPT, users don’t need any coding background or technical knowledge. No installation is required, and the interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, unlike the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-install-auto-gpt-step-by-step/" >full Auto-GPT installation process <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> To ensure you don’t miss out on anything important, let’s talk about the features, settings, and general usage of AgentGPT.</p><h2 id="How-to-Access-AgentGPT"><a href="#How-to-Access-AgentGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Access AgentGPT"></a>How to Access AgentGPT</h2><p> You can get AgentGPT in two ways. For those looking to try out the platform without installation, you simply have to visit <a class="link"   href="https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/" >AgentGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More advanced users can go to the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT" >official AgentGPT GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download and install AgentGPT on their local system.</p><p> Once you’ve got AgentGPT on your device, you can access the platform without an account, with an account, or with an account plus an OpenAI API key. The more credentials you give, the more features you get from AgentGPT.</p><ul><li><strong>No Account:</strong> You can deploy agents as normal but with limited tokens and without the ability to save agents and manage accounts.</li><li><strong>With Account:</strong> Allows you to deploy agents with limited tokens, manage accounts, and save deployed agents.</li><li><strong>With Account and API Key:</strong> Provides features to deploy agents with set tokens, manage accounts, save deployed agents, set agent focus level, and set the maximum number of loops.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Use-AgentGPT"><a href="#How-to-Use-AgentGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Use AgentGPT"></a>How to Use AgentGPT</h2><p> Now that you can access AgentGPT, you can use the platform to your advantage.</p><p> To get a useful output from AgentGPT, you will first need to assemble, configure, and deploy an agent. This agent will be tasked to understand your goal with proper context, identify a list of workable steps, and execute them to provide an output and reach its goal.</p><p> A successful deployment that provides useful output requires properly assembling and configuring your agent before its deployment. Rushing to get your agent deployed will likely result in poor-quality output that doesn’t satisfy expectations.</p><p> Let’s ensure proper deployment by first talking about assembly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Assemble-Agent"><a href="#Step-1-Assemble-Agent" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Assemble Agent"></a>Step 1: Assemble Agent</h3><p> To assemble your agent, you need to provide a name and a goal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/deal-finder.jpg"                      alt="Assembling AgentGPT agent"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We have named our agent “Deal Finder.” You can name your agent anything you want; just make sure that name is related to its function or goal. This will make it easy to identify your agents once you save several of them on your side panel.</p><p> Although the example provides a vague goal, based on how GPT works, I’d advise you to be more specific with your goals. The more specific you are, the more efficient and accurate your agent will be. Since goals are basically prompts, you may want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/" >level up your prompting skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make better goals.</p><p> Now, before clicking that deploy agent button, let’s first configure our agent.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Configure-Agent"><a href="#Step-2-Configure-Agent" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Configure Agent"></a>Step 2: Configure Agent</h3><p> Properly configuring your agent will ensure you get an output that satisfies your expectations. The settings menu lets you choose the GPT model, execution mode, level of focus, tokens, and maximum loops that your agent will do during execution.</p><p> Configure your agent by clicking on <strong>Settings,</strong> located on the lower left of the screen. Here you will see all the basic settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/basic-settings.jpg"                      alt="Basic settings in AgentGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> From here, you can set and configure your API, preferred language, model, and execution mode. Make sure to choose the latest model of GPT, as this will provide a better-performing agent. In terms of mode, you can either choose between <strong>Automatic Mode</strong> or <strong>Pause Mode</strong>. Automatic Mode allows your agent to continue executing tasks until it is finished, while Pause Mode makes your agent pause for every step it takes.</p><p> If you scroll down further, you will see the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> section. This provides advanced settings only available to accounts that provide an API Key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt="Advanced settings in AgentGPT"                ></p><p> Within the advanced settings section, you will see items such as Temp, Loop, and Tokens. These items correspond to:</p><ul><li><strong>Temp:</strong> Determines the level of focus of your agent. The higher the temp, the more focused and deterministic your agent will be.</li><li><strong>Loop:</strong> Sets the maximum number of loops your agent will do for each task.</li><li><strong>Tokens:</strong> Controls the maximum number of tokens your agent can use per action. As a reference, 30 tokens can generate around one or two sentences, while 100 tokens generate one paragraph.</li></ul><p> Using the advanced settings, you can determine the performance of your agent and the quality of its output. Remember to balance these settings properly; the higher they are, the more expensive the operation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-3-Deploy-Agent"><a href="#Step-3-Deploy-Agent" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Deploy Agent"></a>Step 3: Deploy Agent</h3><p> Once you’ve assembled and configured your agent, you hit <strong>Deploy Agent</strong> for your agent to start. You can monitor the entire process through the main console of the website. When finished, you can choose to save the agent to store the output within AgentGPT. You can also save your output locally as a PDF, Image, or just a text copy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/success.jpg"                      alt="PDF generated by AgentGPT"                ></p><p> As you can see, our Deal Finder agent successfully provided us with a promo code, a free shipping voucher, and a bundle offer!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095369/26400" target="_top" id="2095369"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095369"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="512"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095369/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Limitations-of-AgentGPT"><a href="#Limitations-of-AgentGPT" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of AgentGPT"></a>Limitations of AgentGPT</h2><p> Although AgentGPT gave us a usable output, it does have a few limitations. Firstly, AgentGPT is harder to direct as you cannot provide human input when the agent is running. Also, since you can only direct the agent by giving it a goal, you’ll have to be very good at prompting your goal on your first try. Otherwise, your agent will only continue operating until it finishes or you make it stop.</p><p> AgentGPT also does not have local file access. Although safer, it also limits functionalities that require access to your local file system. So if you plan to make a program on your local environment, do some web scrapping, or do anything that involves the need to access local files, you might want to look for other platforms such as Auto-GPT or BabyAGI.</p><p> Lastly, GPT-3.5 limits the potential of AgentGPT. Although <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-4-vs-gpt-35-differences-explained/" >GPT-4 is the next version from GPT-3.5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are significant differences between the two models. This limits AgentGPT to using only text as inputs and outputs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Future-of-AgentGPT"><a href="#The-Future-of-AgentGPT" class="headerlink" title="The Future of AgentGPT"></a>The Future of AgentGPT</h2><p> Although AgentGPT is currently under development, it was able to provide some good output for simple tasks. When the GPT-4 API finally receives a widespread release (it’s currently limited) and AgentGPT moves out of beta, we can expect better performance, more features, and maybe even support for audio, images, and even video! So while we wait, you may want to explore other similar AI assistant platforms, such as Auto-GPT and BabyAGI.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Of course, there are a few things you need to learn before you start.

But have you considered using AI technology to help with your health and fitness journey?</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> ChatGPT is an AI language model that demonstrates the quickly growing popularity and accessibility of AI tools. However, can you trust this advanced technology when it comes to health and fitness information? It may be good at mimicking human writing, but there are some caveats you should be aware of before you start relying on it for health advice.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT’s-Potential-for-Improving-Wellness"><a href="#ChatGPT’s-Potential-for-Improving-Wellness" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT’s Potential for Improving Wellness"></a>ChatGPT’s Potential for Improving Wellness</h2><p> When it comes to wellness information, there are several benefits of using an AI tool, such as ChatGPT:</p><ul><li>ChatGPT is convenient. It’s available 24&#x2F;7 online. It can also provide answers and personalized information quickly, which will save you time compared to having to research health and fitness information on your own.</li><li>The language model also has access to a mammoth amount of information and can provide quick, tailored answers to your questions on health and fitness. This can be a major advantage when you’re short on time (who’s not?) or looking for specific information.</li><li>The AI tool can tailor its advice to your specific circumstances. For instance, it allows you to set parameters and ask follow-up questions so that it can better understand your needs and goals, which can lead to more personalized recommendations.</li><li>ChatGPT is easy to use. If you can think and type, you can use ChatGPT. Eventually, as tech companies integrate these systems into voice assistants, you might not even need to do the typing! This makes ChatGPT accessible to people of varying ages and technical abilities.</li></ul><h2 id="Examples-of-How-ChatGPT-Can-Be-Used-for-Health-and-Fitness-Advice"><a href="#Examples-of-How-ChatGPT-Can-Be-Used-for-Health-and-Fitness-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Examples of How ChatGPT Can Be Used for Health and Fitness Advice"></a>Examples of How ChatGPT Can Be Used for Health and Fitness Advice</h2><p> There are several use cases for ChatGPT in the realm of health and wellness. For starters, you could use the AI tool to provide you with nutrition advice, including general recommendations on healthy eating habits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-2023-02-09-at-1-48-14-pm.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT giving health advice"                ></p><p> It can also be used to generate advice on weekly meal plans based on your body type, sex, activity level, age, food preferences, and health goals (whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or something else).</p><p> You could also use ChatGPT to generate workout plans based on your fitness level, goals, and even the type of equipment or time you have available. It may direct you to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-yoga-apps-help-workout-anywhere/" >great yoga app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or one of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-workout-apps/" >the best workout apps to get in shape <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> When it comes to sleeping better, the AI model can offer you tips and recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, such as helping you create a wind-down routine or offering advice on how to create a relaxing, sleep-inducing environment.</p><p> You could also use ChatGPT to provide information on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including how to protect yourself from illness. Or you can ask it to make recommendations for cancer screenings based on your factors (e.g. age, sex, and family history).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Limitations-of-Relying-on-ChatGPT-for-Health-and-Fitness-Advice"><a href="#Limitations-of-Relying-on-ChatGPT-for-Health-and-Fitness-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Relying on ChatGPT for Health and Fitness Advice"></a>Limitations of Relying on ChatGPT for Health and Fitness Advice</h2><p> It’s important to remember that AI technology is only as good as the data it’s trained on. According to ChatGPT’s developers,<a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-general-faq" >Open AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , “ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.”</p><p> In addition, the developers note, “ChatGPT will occasionally make up facts or ‘hallucinate’ outputs.” This is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >biggest problems with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s certainly a reason to be especially vigilant when evaluating the health and wellness responses you receive from the AI model. It’s why OpenAI itself recommends checking the accuracy of responses.</p><p> In addition, ChatGPT does not currently cite its sources like other AI systems (e.g.<a class="link"   href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" >Perplexity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). While it’s worth noting that even the advice provided by doctors evolves over time and may be limited by current scientific knowledge, it’s important to verify medical information with reliable sources, such as your doctor. ChatGPT’s limited knowledge of the world after 2021 means it may not be aware of the most current health advice or advances.</p><p> If you’re going to use ChatGPT as one source of health and fitness advice, there are some tips and tricks you can follow to improve the quality of information you receive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-and-Tricks-for-Improving-Relevance-of-Health-and-Fitness-Recommendations"><a href="#Tips-and-Tricks-for-Improving-Relevance-of-Health-and-Fitness-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Tips and Tricks for Improving Relevance of Health and Fitness Recommendations"></a>Tips and Tricks for Improving Relevance of Health and Fitness Recommendations</h2><p> Here are some tips and tricks for getting the most reliable health and fitness information from ChatGPT:</p><ul><li><strong>Fact check</strong> . Because ChatGPT can be prone to providing false or inaccurate information, you need to compare its recommendations with other sources and healthcare professionals. You could even ask ChatGPT to direct you to reputable sources of health and fitness information.</li><li><strong>Consider the context</strong> . Because health and fitness advice can vary so much between individuals, you will want to provide the model with as much personal information as possible, including your health history, goals, and current circumstances, before asking it to generate a response.</li><li><strong>Ask for clarification</strong> . If the information provided by ChatGPT seems unclear or incomplete, ask it for additional information. You can even ask ChatGPT to ask you questions to better understand your individual needs before providing you with a response.</li><li><strong>Be specific</strong> . The information provided by ChatGPT will be as specific as you ask it to be. For instance, if you ask it simple, single-sentence questions such as, “How can I lose weight?” you’ll get general responses. However, if you figure out how to focus the model with parameters and guidelines, it is more likely to provide the advice you can use.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-Use-ChatGPT-to-Get-Trustworthy-Health-Information"><a href="#Can-You-Use-ChatGPT-to-Get-Trustworthy-Health-Information" class="headerlink" title="Can You Use ChatGPT to Get Trustworthy Health Information?"></a>Can You Use ChatGPT to Get Trustworthy Health Information?</h2><p> So, can ChatGPT be trusted for health and fitness advice? The answer is, as with most things in life, it depends. Would you use Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook for health and wellness advice? You might, but you shouldn’t rely on those as your only sources of information.</p><p> But you use these services for inspiration, reminders, and support on your health and fitness journey! Similarly, you should use ChatGPT as just one tool in your wellness toolkit, and always make informed decisions based on sources you trust.</p><p> In the end, the decision to use ChatGPT for health and fitness advice is up to you. Be aware of its potential benefits and drawbacks as you weigh its answers. Just like with any online source of information, it’s always a good idea to take its advice with a grain of salt and to do additional research before making any major changes to your health and fitness routine.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins

I have no idea who could have guided it this way.”</p><p> For any casual observer, Musk’s chortling about being based is anything but, landing more on the toe-curling plane of discomfort, delivering a visceral sense of embarrassment. But for Musk’s legion of fans, xAI’s Grok is the long-awaited “answer to the monstrosity of WokeGPT,” a reference to the boundaries and perceived neutering of ChatGPT’s capabilities by OpenAI.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Does-Grok-Perform-Is-Grok-Better-Than-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-Does-Grok-Perform-Is-Grok-Better-Than-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How Does Grok Perform? Is Grok Better Than ChatGPT?"></a>How Does Grok Perform? Is Grok Better Than ChatGPT?</h2><p> Given only a minute number of users have been given access to Grok so far, most of what we know about its performance comes from xAI. The company was keen to stress that “Grok is still a very early beta product” and that its current performance is “the best we could do with 2 months of training.”</p><p> Even so, Grok appears to be on the right track. According to xAI’s research, its prototype Grok-0 model was trained using 33 billion parameters and outperformed the Llama 2 70 billion parameter model in standardized machine learning benchmarking and testing. After some tweaks (and presumably an expanded set of parameters), Grok-1 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (around 175 billion parameters).</p><p> However, in a further boon to Musk and Grok, during a final round of testing on the 2023 Hungarian National High School Final Exams in Mathematics (yes, obscure, but purposefully so to avoid the chance the data has been uploaded to an existing LLM, which would give it an advantage), Grok came second only to OpenAI’s GPT-4.</p><p> Musk has also observed that Grok’s direct internet access will give it an advantage over other generative AI tools that lack access.</p><p> Currently, it’s difficult to say whether Grok is better than ChatGPT, and it’s clear that Grok is speeding forward based on the work already laid out by other AI research companies.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Will-Grok-Cost-Who-Can-Use-Grok"><a href="#How-Much-Will-Grok-Cost-Who-Can-Use-Grok" class="headerlink" title="How Much Will Grok Cost? Who Can Use Grok?"></a>How Much Will Grok Cost? Who Can Use Grok?</h2><p> Grok is still currently in early testing. Limited beta access has been granted to a small number of X Premium Plus users, which currently costs $16 per month. Once Grok leaves its beta period, it will become available to all X Premium Plus subscribers, dangling a weighty AI-shaped carrot over X verification.</p><p> It’s currently unknown if Grok will come with a free access tier, which all other major generative AI tools offer. For example, OpenAI keeps its less-powerful ChatGPT-3.5 model free, while Anthropic offers a free version of Claude.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Increase-Conversational-Quality-Key-Techniques-for-ChatGPT-Improvement"><a href="#Increase-Conversational-Quality-Key-Techniques-for-ChatGPT-Improvement" class="headerlink" title="Increase Conversational Quality: Key Techniques for ChatGPT Improvement"></a>Increase Conversational Quality: Key Techniques for ChatGPT Improvement</h2><p> ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool that can produce stunning, human-like responses to your questions and prompts. But did you know that there are techniques that can get more precise and relevant answers to your prompts?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Just by adding a few provisos or setting some scenarios, ChatGPT can produce more tailored answers to your queries. Let’s look at some of the ways you can improve the quality of your ChatGPT responses.</p><h2 id="1-Assign-a-Role"><a href="#1-Assign-a-Role" class="headerlink" title="1. Assign a Role"></a>1. Assign a Role</h2><p> One way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-best-results-from-chatgpt/" >get the best results from ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is to assign it a role. This is a fantastic method of getting more appropriate responses to your prompts. Asking ChatGPT a question will always produce a response of some sort, but its relevance might not be suited to your requirements.</p><p> This can be easily remedied by framing your question within a role. For example, we asked ChatGPT this question—“Can you explain the workings of the sun?”</p><p> In the first instance, we asked this question without assigning a role:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-response-to-an-unframed-question-about-the-sun.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to an unframed question about the sun"                ></p><p> The answer goes into some detail about atomic nuclei and the process of fusion. But what if your target audience was a class full of five-year-olds? This is where assigning a role can help. Let’s try it again and this time assign it the role of a teacher.</p><p> The technique is simple, start by assigning a role. In this case, we told ChatGPT to assume the role of a primary school teacher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-assuming-the-role-of-a-teacher.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT assuming the role of a teacher"                ></p><p> As you can see, this is a far more suitable response for a class of young kids. This is one example of how assigning a role to ChatGPT can improve the relevance of its response.</p><p> There are plenty of examples of where assigning a role can help produce more tailored responses. For instance, you can tell ChatGPT to assume such roles as a travel guide, Linux terminal, movie critic, and English translator, among many others. You can even tell it to be a fictional character.</p><p> The only limit is your imagination, and it’s a fun thing to try too.</p><h2 id="2-Define-Your-Communication-Channel-and-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Define-Your-Communication-Channel-and-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Define Your Communication Channel and Target Audience"></a>2. Define Your Communication Channel and Target Audience</h2><p> If you are looking for ChatGPT to produce some creative writing, then you can achieve far more impressive results by giving it relevant information. In this instance, you can refine the output by supplying information about the intended use of the output and some demographics of the target audience.</p><p> For example, imagine you are creating a YouTube script about the equipment you would need to start a needlework hobby. We began by prompting it with a simple question—“What equipment do I need to start a needlework hobby?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-response-to-basic-question-about-needlework.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to basic question about needlework"                ></p><p> The response was a numbered list of seven items you would need to get started. This is fine, but it isn’t going to set YouTube alight. Now, we refined the prompt to cover the output type and the main target audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-response-to-refined-needlework-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to refined needlework prompt"                ></p><p> The generated response was much more precisely tailored to suit the required output.</p><h2 id="3-Chained-Prompts"><a href="#3-Chained-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="3. Chained Prompts"></a>3. Chained Prompts</h2><p> ChatGPT will quite happily write a page of content for your website if so prompted. However, there are some drawbacks to simply prompting it to “write a page for my website”. Firstly, there are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/do-chatgpt-responses-have-character-or-word-limit/" >limits to the length of response that ChatGPT can output <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This means you might not get a full response.</p><p> But chained prompts allow you to tailor the content to ensure that it matches your needs with specific information and keywords. To show how effective this can be, we started by prompting it to write the homepage content for a pest control website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-response-to-homepage-response.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to homepage response"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The response is some fairly generic text that is reasonably well-written but isn’t entirely suitable as homepage content. But by using chained prompts you can improve the results. We started by asking for homepage headings for a pest control company in Michigan:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-ot-chatgpt-prompt-for-headings-and-subheadings.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT prompt for headings and subheadings"                ></p><p> Now, we can chain our prompts to generate content for each heading. In this case, we asked for a short paragraph and three bullet points, and we also asked for the inclusion of some keywords. As you can see the response remembered that the content was for a Michigan-based company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-follow-up-question-to-chatgpt-homepage-headers.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of follow up question to ChatGPT homepage headers"                ></p><p> Using the chaining technique allows you to precisely tailor responses for more relevant results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Format-Your-Output-in-Markdown"><a href="#4-Format-Your-Output-in-Markdown" class="headerlink" title="4. Format Your Output in Markdown"></a>4. Format Your Output in Markdown</h2><p> Unless instructed to do otherwise, ChatGPT responses are generated in plain text. However, it can also handle the markup language called markdown, and if requested it will produce the requested output in this format.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-is-markdown-popular-reasons-you-should-use-it/" >Markdown is an incredibly popular and powerful language for creating web-ready content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> As an example, we asked ChatGPT to write a short blog post about the four inner planets in the solar system. First, we did it without any formatting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-response-to-basic-solar-system-article-request.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to basic solar system article request"                ></p><p> Next, we reframed the question to output the result in markdown language and to include headings and a table summarizing some of the information:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-using-markup-language.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT using Markup language"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

So powerful, that with a few instructions, it can generate its own prompts and offer you a choice of routes for your research to go down.</p><p> In this instance, we started by inputting the following prompt:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-answering-question-about-creating-prompts.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT answering question about creating prompts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> ChatGPT then asked us for more detail about the purpose of the prompts. Obviously, the more detail you provide here, the more accurate the response will be. But for the sake of brevity, we kept it short and sweet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-generating-prompts.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT generating prompts"                ></p><p> Once ChatGPT has created relevant prompts, you can use the prompt simply by referring to its number:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-exanding-on-a-numbered-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT exanding on a numbered prompt"                ></p><h2 id="6-Let-Your-Personality-Shine-by-Adding-Some-Character-to-the-Response"><a href="#6-Let-Your-Personality-Shine-by-Adding-Some-Character-to-the-Response" class="headerlink" title="6. Let Your Personality Shine by Adding Some Character to the Response"></a>6. Let Your Personality Shine by Adding Some Character to the Response</h2><p> There is no doubt that ChatGPT responds with human-like answers. But if you were stuck on a six-hour plane flight with a human that responded like ChatGPT’s default replies, you’d soon be bored to tears.</p><p> However, with a few tweaks to your prompts, you can generate answers with a little more personality. The example below compares a standard answer with one that includes a little bit of injected personality.</p><p> We asked ChatGPT to write one hundred words on the dry subject of fiscal procurement:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-chatgpt-response-to-write-100-words-on-fiscal-procurement.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT response to write 100 words on fiscal procurement"                ></p><p> Well done if you managed to stay awake when reading the response. Let’s see if we can spice it up a bit. This time we asked it to write it in a lighthearted manner and include some dry humor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-lighthearted-chatgpt-response-on-fiscal-procurement.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of lighthearted ChatGPT response on Fiscal Procurement"                ></p><p> Now, while it may not have your audience rolling on the floor in laughter, it is a far more interesting reply than the previous one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Chain-of-Thought-Prompting"><a href="#7-Chain-of-Thought-Prompting" class="headerlink" title="7. Chain-of-Thought Prompting"></a>7. Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h2><p> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting could be likened to a student in an exam showing their workings. It involves starting with a seed question or idea and then using the model’s responses to further refine and develop the topic.</p><p> For instance, if we ask ChatGPT a simple question with a numeric answer we get this response. The first question is the seed question and lays out to ChatGPT the format of the response we expect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-cot-basic-answer.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of CoT Basic Answer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now we can repeat the process and add some detail to the seed question:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-of-cot-chatgpt-answer.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of CoT ChatGPT Answer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As you can see, ChatGPT will respond and show the chain of thought that generated the correct answer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Using-Prompt-Techniques-to-Improve-the-Response-From-ChatGPT"><a href="#Using-Prompt-Techniques-to-Improve-the-Response-From-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Using Prompt Techniques to Improve the Response From ChatGPT"></a>Using Prompt Techniques to Improve the Response From ChatGPT</h2><p> Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are incredibly powerful even without these prompting techniques.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Essential-ChatGPT-Handbook"><a href="#The-Essential-ChatGPT-Handbook" class="headerlink" title="The Essential ChatGPT Handbook"></a>The Essential ChatGPT Handbook</h2><p> Initially released in November 2022, ChatGPT gave many of us an intriguing glimpse into what a future with AI might look like. Perhaps one where we don’t need to fret over how to write an email to our boss or can call on an AI personal assistant to explain difficult concepts quickly and simply.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Besides being able to compose a work email, ChatGPT can give you feedback on your presentation, suggest an itinerary for a weekend away, or brainstorm new ideas when you’re out of mental energy. With ChatGPT, you type your request and hit enter to see a response appear before you in a matter of seconds.</p><p> Want to learn how to use ChatGPT? We’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT?"></a>What Is ChatGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/home-page-of-chatgpt-website-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="Home page of ChatGPT website october 2023"                ></p><p> ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot that can answer almost any question you have—just as if Google were a person you could have a casual conversation with.</p><p> ChatGPT is special because it doesn’t feel like you’re talking to a computer. It can converse in natural language and remember things you’ve asked before, and in the first of its kind, it can understand voice and images too. If you took a picture of the contents inside your refrigerator, for example, it could suggest something you might want to cook for dinner based on the ingredients you have.</p><p> Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT was trained on an enormous amount of data from the internet, which probably included troves of information from places like Wikipedia, blogs, how-to websites, and scientific articles. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-chatgpt-accessing-up-to-date-information-means/" >ChatGPT can now browse the web <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adding more power to an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Works"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Works" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Works"></a>How ChatGPT Works</h2><p> ChatGPT was trained using a mix of machine learning and human intervention, using a method called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p><p> In fact, the first stage of training involved humans playing the role of both a human user and an AI assistant having a conversation. This helped demonstrate responses that humans prefer and go towards building a large dataset to feed the model.</p><p> Next, a reward model needed to be created for reinforcement learning. To do this, human AI trainers once again stepped in, but this time, they were asked to rank several model answers by quality, further helping ChatGPT choose the best response.</p><p> All of this is to say humans had a hand in helping to train ChatGPT to achieve a higher level of accuracy in its answers, but also to make sure that it sounded natural to talk to.</p><p> Far from being perfect, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >there are many problems facing ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, from confidently stating wrong facts to being a weapon for disinformation.

It will ask you for an email and phone number, plus the main reason you want to use OpenAI, whether for research, app development, or personal use. Once signed up, head back to <a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get started, and log in to your ChatGPT account.</p><p> You can also use your OpenAI account to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/" >generate images from text using DALL-E <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, another AI model developed by OpenAI.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-to-Use-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Use ChatGPT"></a>How to Use ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chatgpt-interface-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT interface October 2023"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Using ChatGPT is simple, thanks to a minimalist interface. After the ChatGPT login page, like an ordinary messaging app, you type in the text box and hit enter or click the send button (paper airplane symbol).</p><p> Responses are generated quite fast, appearing directly underneath your question. Any follow-up questions will be added to the conversation thread, which you can look back on at any time.</p><p> Conversations are saved and stored in a panel on the left. If you want to start a fresh conversation, click the <strong>trash can icon</strong> beside the conversation heading to delete the thread, or press the <strong>New Chat</strong> button to start a new one.</p><p> ChatGPT is optimized for dialogue, so you don’t need to type out full sentences each time you have a follow-up question. You can try asking ChatGPT to summarize an answer or paraphrase a response if it doesn’t seem to answer your question well at first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-to-summarize-a-response.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to summarize a response"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Ask-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-to-Ask-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What to Ask ChatGPT"></a>What to Ask ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-for-a-few-iconic-places-to-visit-in-nyc.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT for a few iconic places to visit in NYC"                ></p><p> Many people turn to Google when they want to ask how something works, but sifting through a website takes time. Instead of putting that question to the internet, you can use ChatGPT to get a quick and straightforward answer.</p><p> Not to mention, there’s the added benefit of having no annoying ads. You can also ask ChatGPT to present the information in the best way for you, for example, as a bullet point list instead of a paragraph. And if the answer is going way over your head, request the info to be simplified for better understanding.</p><p> There are plenty of interesting <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, the chance to access real-time information might be worth it to you.</p><p> As we have noted, however, it comes with pros and cons. It can access more accurate and up-to-date information about current events, but it’s entirely susceptible to misinformation and trolls. Take ChatGPTs answers with a grain of salt, and always do further research if you plan to use the info in a high-risk application.</p><p> Avoid using ChatGPT for medical advice, and don’t ask it for investment tips.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="ChatGPT-and-Career-Growth-Exploring-6-Approaches"><a href="#ChatGPT-and-Career-Growth-Exploring-6-Approaches" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT and Career Growth: Exploring 6 Approaches"></a>ChatGPT and Career Growth: Exploring 6 Approaches</h2><p> Job hunting can sometimes feel like being stuck in a hamster wheel. You tirelessly scour job boards and spend hours crafting the perfect application, only to get nothing in return. But what if you could break free from the time-consuming, effort-intensive job search cycle and adopt smarter ways to find your dream job?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> What if ChatGPT could help you transform your job search experience? We’ve put together six practical ways to use ChatGPT in your job search. Here’s how.</p><h2 id="1-Make-Sense-of-Job-Post-Descriptions"><a href="#1-Make-Sense-of-Job-Post-Descriptions" class="headerlink" title="1. Make Sense of Job Post Descriptions"></a>1. Make Sense of Job Post Descriptions</h2><p> Job postings can sometimes be overwhelming. They are often packed with technical jargon and niche language. This can make it challenging to understand what the job entails, which is what you’ll really need to know once you come across a job ad.</p><p> ChatGPT can help you analyze job posts to give you a clear picture of what a job is really about. It will also use this picture of what the job entails to guide you through what to include in your resume and cover letter, as well as the skills to emphasize.</p><p> In an era where recruiters use software to scan and filter through thousands of job applications to find the best candidates, ChatGPT can help you identify the keywords and phrases that recruiters and hiring managers will be looking for. But how can you do this with ChatGPT?</p><p> I’ll provide you with a job description in my next prompt. Your goal is to help me make sense of the job description and use it to answer questions I’ll be asking.</p><ol><li>Copy and paste the prompt above or a variation that suits your needs.</li><li>Copy and paste the job post. Provide as much information as you can find.</li><li>If after pasting the job post, ChatGPT does not start explaining the job role, use a prompt like “make sense of the job description above” to get the chatbot to describe the job role.</li><li>After ChatGPT finishes the preliminary explanation, you now start asking questions. You can ask questions like:  <ul><li>What are some keywords or phrases that I should include in my resume or cover letter when applying for this job?  </li><li>Can you suggest any specific experiences that I should highlight in my application?</li></ul></li></ol><p> By using ChatGPT to make sense of job descriptions, you can precisely tailor your application materials for each job you apply for and increase your chances of getting hired.</p><h2 id="2-Create-Resumes-and-Cover-Letters"><a href="#2-Create-Resumes-and-Cover-Letters" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Resumes and Cover Letters"></a>2. Create Resumes and Cover Letters</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-of-chatgpt-generated-cover-letter-for-worldatlas-focusing-on-soft-skills.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT generated cover letter for WorldAtlas focusing on soft skills"                ></p><p> Once you’re ready for an intense job search, there are a few hurdles you’ll need to overcome. One of such hurdles is creating resumes and cover letters—a lot of them. While the bulk of creative inputs in your resumes and cover letters should come from you, ChatGPT can help you improve the quality of your resumes, and produce a lot of copies in a short time.</p><p> You see, when on a job search, there is a good chance that you’ll be applying to many companies. With this in mind, you’ll need a lot of personalized resumes specially crafted to target each company you are applying to.</p><p> Manually crafting personalized resumes and cover letters for each company can be a tedious task. But if you furnish ChatGPT with important professional information, the AI chatbot can generate multiple personalized documents simultaneously.</p><p> Just asking ChatGPT to whip up a resume isn’t going to cut it if you’re hoping to create a truly impressive and effective one. But don’t panic; we’ve previously put together a detailed <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-to-write-resume/" >step-by-step guide on how to create a resume with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-cover-letter-using-chatgpt/" >guide to creating a cover letter with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Prepare-for-Interviews"><a href="#3-Prepare-for-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="3. Prepare for Interviews"></a>3. Prepare for Interviews</h2><p> You’ve jumped through all the hurdles of identifying a job opportunity, researching the company, crafting a fitting resume, and now you’ve gotten an invitation. There’s just one thing standing in your way—the interview.</p><p> Fortunately, like almost everything in your job search journey, ChatGPT can also help with that. If you’re unsure how to prep ChatGPT for a mock interview, here’s a good template prompt to help you get started.</p><p> I would like to role-play an interview scenario with you, where you act as the interviewer, and I will be the candidate applying for the PHP software developer position in your company. Your company is ABC Ltd, a language learning and translation startup that offers language translation services and language opportunities. Your role is to ask me interview questions one by one and wait for my answers. Please do not provide explanations or write the entire conversation at once. Treat it like a real interview and ask follow-up questions based on my responses. While asking follow-up questions, do not go down the rabbit hole. The depth of a follow-up should be 2 to 5 questions before asking a new set of questions. To begin, my first prompt is ‘Hi.’</p><p> read more</p><p> To use the prompt template above, replace the placeholder position and company details with a job role, company name, and description of what the company does. During the interview, you can ask ChatGPT to critique your responses to a question and rate how you’re doing so far.</p><h2 id="4-Prepare-for-Salary-Negotiation"><a href="#4-Prepare-for-Salary-Negotiation" class="headerlink" title="4. Prepare for Salary Negotiation"></a>4. Prepare for Salary Negotiation</h2><p> Salary negotiations are typically one of the trickiest parts of the interview process. You’d want as much money as possible, but you don’t want to appear too ambitious. ChatGPT can help you strike a balance and deal with this dilemma like a pro. But how?</p><p> You can use the AI chatbot to research a reasonable salary for your industry, specific company, and particular role. How’s that different from simply googling? Well, Google would provide a lot of generic information, but ChatGPT can take a lot of things into consideration when responding.</p><p> To effectively use ChatGPT for salary research, you’ll need to first provide the chatbot with your level of experience, the country, and state where the job is located, whether the job will be remote or onsite, and as much job-related information as possible. After providing this information, you can then prompt the chatbot for help in deciding on a suitable range of salary to settle for.</p><p> In the screenshot below, we asked ChatGPT to list some factors a jobseeker with 15 years of experience in the programming field who is applying for a programming writer role in a start-up at the heart of California should consider.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salary-range-negotiation.jpg"                      alt="Salary range negotiation using ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Of course, you can ask for the exact salary range or any other details that interest you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Identify-Career-Opportunities"><a href="#5-Identify-Career-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="5. Identify Career Opportunities"></a>5. Identify Career Opportunities</h2><p> The job market is like an iceberg; you only get to see a portion of its actual size. Advertised jobs are only a small fraction of the opportunities that exist. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shining-light-hidden-job-market-andrew-seaman/" >poll on LinkedIn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as much as 50% to 70% of job openings fall under the “hidden job market” category, meaning they are never posted publicly. This hidden market is vast and largely untapped, leaving many opportunities waiting to be discovered.</p><p> So, if you rely only on job boards and LinkedIn to find your next opportunity, you could miss out on a world of possibilities. But how do you find unadvertised opportunities? Well, you can start by proactively reaching out to companies, and ChatGPT can help you with that.</p><p> In the screenshot below, we asked ChatGPT to identify some potential job opportunities at Microsoft for a technical writer. It gave some good hints.

We’ll be making these features accessible via a new beta panel in your settings, which is rolling out to all Plus users over the course of the next week.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Are-ChatGPT-Plugins"><a href="#What-Are-ChatGPT-Plugins" class="headerlink" title="What Are ChatGPT Plugins?"></a>What Are ChatGPT Plugins?</h2><p> ChatGPT Plugins are internet-connected tools specifically designed to extend ChatGPT’s functionality.</p><p> Until now, ChatGPT’s official data cut-off point was towards the end of 2021, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >one of ChatGPT’s main limitations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Where other tools like Microsoft’s Bing AI Chat and the newly updated Google Bard connect to the internet to research up-to-date information, ChatGPT lagged behind.</p><p> The first set of ChatGPT Plugins was created and developed by companies such as Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier, and will drastically expand ChatGPT’s understanding, integration, and usefulness.</p><p> For example, when you gain access to ChatGPT Plugins, you’ll be able to use the ChatGPT Kayak Plugin to search for and streamline holiday ideas, find the best deals, and create unique holiday ideas, all from the warm embrace of the ChatGPT interface.</p><p> Unfortunately, my ChatGPT Plus account doesn’t have access to any Plugins yet.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Can-Browse-the-Web"><a href="#ChatGPT-Can-Browse-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Can Browse the Web"></a>ChatGPT Can Browse the Web</h2><p> That’s not all, though.</p><p> OpenAI has also finally granted ChatGPT internet access.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Blank-Page-to-Book-9-Ways-ChatGPT-Aids-Writers"><a href="#From-Blank-Page-to-Book-9-Ways-ChatGPT-Aids-Writers" class="headerlink" title="From Blank Page to Book: 9 Ways ChatGPT Aids Writers"></a>From Blank Page to Book: 9 Ways ChatGPT Aids Writers</h2><p> Getting struck by a good and entertaining idea is the easy part; articulating it in written form is the real challenge.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Prior to the era of AI, many writers honed their skills by immersing themselves in books, capturing their own ideas, or turning to instructional writing videos on YouTube. Although these methods still hold value, the emergence of AI is reshaping the way we express our creative ideas, rendering faster results.</p><p> If you’re an aspiring novelist or struggling with writer’s block, ChatGPT can lend you a helping hand as you embark on your novel-writing journey.</p><h2 id="1-Research-the-Type-of-Novel-You-Want-to-Write"><a href="#1-Research-the-Type-of-Novel-You-Want-to-Write" class="headerlink" title="1. Research the Type of Novel You Want to Write"></a>1. Research the Type of Novel You Want to Write</h2><p> The first step in writing a book is to do research about your concept. This will include the narrative structure, length, and tropes to avoid (or incorporate).</p><p> Furthermore, it entails conducting in-depth research into the actual story. Ideally, you should write about what you already know, but since you won’t possess complete knowledge, you’ll have to supplement your understanding through research. This involves immersing yourself in the world where the story takes place.</p><p> For instance, if your story is set in Madrid, you’ll need to make yourself familiar with the local culture and the city’s dynamics. Similarly, if one of the characters suffers from an illness, you’ll need to comprehend the genuine impact it can have on them.</p><p> This type of research can drag out the process, which could leave you feeling overwhelmed or demotivated by the time you get to the writing part. This is where ChatGPT comes in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-what-tropes-to-avoid-crime-thriller-novel.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT What Tropes to Avoid in a Crime Thriller Novel"                ></p><p> Simply ask “what is the best narrative structure for a crime thriller”. Or, if there’s something in your book that necessitates specialized knowledge, like how an ice skating tournament works, ask exactly that and ChatGPT will generate the relevant information in a summary.</p><p> Keep in mind that the chatbot might generate inaccurate answers, which is just one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >big problems with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so it’s essential to verify the results. You also need to ensure that whatever information you derive from ChatGPT is compatible with your theme; don’t just settle for the first answer it spits out.</p><h2 id="2-Has-Anyone-Else-Used-the-Same-Idea-Already"><a href="#2-Has-Anyone-Else-Used-the-Same-Idea-Already" class="headerlink" title="2. Has Anyone Else Used the Same Idea Already?"></a>2. Has Anyone Else Used the Same Idea Already?</h2><p> Now that you have your idea and research notes ready to go, it’s time to get to work. But before investing potentially months into bringing your idea to life, it’s essential to check if anyone else has already used it.</p><p> We are all influenced and inspired by the art and media around us, so it is possible that your concept is based on another book you’ve read or film you’ve watched. These ideas can take root in our minds, disguising themselves as our own. Just ask ChatGPT if your idea already exists.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-checking-the-originality-of-story-idea.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Check the Originality of Novel Concept"                ></p><p> Your story will most likely draw upon a widely recognized framework of narratives in literature and film, such as an alien invasion or a money heist. So you need to be very specific with your prompt to ensure that ChatGPT has every element of your story to check its originality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Generate-an-Organized-Outline"><a href="#3-Generate-an-Organized-Outline" class="headerlink" title="3. Generate an Organized Outline"></a>3. Generate an Organized Outline</h2><p> If you’re a pantser, we envy you—the outlining process can get tedious. But having an outline will help make the writing process easier, so it’s worth the extra work.</p><p> ChatGPT is an absolute gem when it comes to outlining. Let’s say you’ve settled on the three-act structure, specify that at the beginning of your prompt, then follow with a synopsis of your story. All you need to do is get the timeline of events in the correct order, and ChatGPT will give you an organized outline.</p><p> Editing the outline is critical; add any details ChatGPT missed, remove things that you don’t like, or ask the chatbot to generate a new outline altogether. Now you’ve got something to work with, and it didn’t take all day to put together!</p><h2 id="4-Flesh-Out-the-Characters-and-World"><a href="#4-Flesh-Out-the-Characters-and-World" class="headerlink" title="4. Flesh Out the Characters and World"></a>4. Flesh Out the Characters and World</h2><p> If you don’t have a clear vision of your characters or the world they’re in, then you won’t be able to paint a picture for your readers.</p><p> You might already have an idea of who your protagonist is, but what about what they look like, their history, behaviors, goals, and flaws? Ask ChatGPT for ideas, or input a general description of what you already have in mind to get something more detailed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-elaborating-on-world-for-novel.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Elaborate on the World of Story Idea"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The same goes for world. Don’t know how to elaborate on “a dark forest”? Ask ChatGPT.</p><p> You can add the results to your outline or in separate notes, but note it down somehow. Always refer back to these notes as you are writing.</p><h2 id="5-Develop-Your-Plot"><a href="#5-Develop-Your-Plot" class="headerlink" title="5. Develop Your Plot"></a>5. Develop Your Plot</h2><p> Our foremost suggestion is to focus on character arc. Most readers tend to stay engaged when they genuinely care about the characters and their journey, even if the plot isn’t phenomenal. But that doesn’t mean that you should skimp on plot development.</p><p> Whether you’re struggling to go from scene to scene or need ideas for the overarching progression of your story, ChatGPT can help. You can even ask it for unique plot twist ideas if you want to steer clear of clichés.</p><h2 id="6-Ask-for-Paraphrases-and-Synonyms"><a href="#6-Ask-for-Paraphrases-and-Synonyms" class="headerlink" title="6. Ask for Paraphrases and Synonyms"></a>6. Ask for Paraphrases and Synonyms</h2><p> Once you begin writing, it’s crucial to maintain momentum and not get caught up in perfecting it at the moment. Every writer will encounter a situation where they know what they want to say, they just don’t know how to say it. But you should keep writing nonetheless. The key is to get your thoughts written down, even if it’s just the opening scene, even if it’s messy.</p><p> After revising your written work, you’ll no doubt want to change some, if not most, of it. Put grammar aside for now and look at how you can improve the storytelling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-paraphrasing-options-of-novel-scene.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Paraphrase My Own Written Work for Novel Draft"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Ask ChatGPT to paraphrase what you wrote. Don’t copy-paste the results as it won’t be able to capture the undertone of your story, but you might stumble upon better words to convey it.</p><p> It might be worth including “show, don’t tell” at the beginning of your prompt so you can get into the habit of creating an immersive story for your readers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Check-Your-Grammar"><a href="#7-Check-Your-Grammar" class="headerlink" title="7. Check Your Grammar"></a>7. Check Your Grammar</h2><p> Ideally, you shouldn’t edit while you write, at least the mechanical aspect of the text such as grammar. If you do this, you’ll never complete your novel.</p><p> Once you’ve completed and revised the story, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/" >use ChatGPT as a proofreader <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check your grammar, spelling, punctuation, and even passive voice.</p><p> Remember that ChatGPT might not always get it right, plus grammar rules aren’t the same across the board, so it might be worth getting a human copy editor instead.</p><h2 id="8-Generate-Novel-Title-Ideas"><a href="#8-Generate-Novel-Title-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="8. Generate Novel Title Ideas"></a>8. Generate Novel Title Ideas</h2><p> The title of your novel is going to be what draws readers in, so it needs to be captivating. There are no rules here, it can be one word or ten, simple or complex, as long as it reflects your story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-generate-novel-title-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Generate Novel Title Ideas"                ></p><p> If you have no idea where to begin, jot down the main themes of your story and ask ChatGPT to generate title ideas based on that. You can also do this for individual chapter names.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631056&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/997e65474a248252883b485717f7d098/products/buy-windows.png"                      border="0"                >Allavsoft Batch Download Online Videos, Music Offline to MP4, MP3, MOV, etc format </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-Generate-Book-Cover-Art-Ideas"><a href="#9-Generate-Book-Cover-Art-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="9. Generate Book Cover Art Ideas"></a>9. Generate Book Cover Art Ideas</h2><p> In addition to the title, the visuals of your book also play a crucial role in captivating readers. If you’re hiring a photographer or graphic designer, it’s essential to convey your artistic vision to them.</p><p> While ChatGPT can’t generate images, you can ask for some inspiration. Of course, you could always <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/" >use an AI art generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to visually illustrate your concept to your designer.

Put the methods above into practice and see if it helps you make better progress.</p><p> While ChatGPT provides valuable assistance, it’s important to have realistic expectations. It can’t write an entire book for you as it won’t be able to convey the essence of your story or give you unique character voices. It’s just a tool that lightens the load; you still need to do the heavy lifting yourself.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Prior to the era of AI, many writers honed their skills by immersing themselves in books, capturing their own ideas, or turning to instructional writing videos on YouTube. Although these methods still hold value, the emergence of AI is reshaping the way we express our creative ideas, rendering faster results.</p><p> If you’re an aspiring novelist or struggling with writer’s block, ChatGPT can lend you a helping hand as you embark on your novel-writing journey.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-flawless-soundscape-secrets-to-high-resolution-audio-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Flawless Soundscape  Secrets to High-Resolution Audio Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vanish-without-a-trace-tips-for-anonymous-instagram-live/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Vanish Without A Trace  Tips for Anonymous Instagram Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-flashback-to-fame-retro-trends-in-todays-twitter-world-for-2024/"><u>[New] Flashback to Fame  Retro Trends in Today's Twitter World for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-live-tv-battle-who-wins-obs-or-twitch-studio-for-2024/"><u>[New] Live TV Battle  Who Wins?

You can write a cover letter, explain a complex topic, or prepare for an interview, among other options. Depending on the topic, you might want to re-read the conversation, so it’s useful that ChatGPT saves and stores the previous conversations for you.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But if ChatGPT isn’t saving the chat history, you’ll have to repeat some of your prompts all over again. So, how do you fix ChaGPT when it won’t save your conversations?</p><h2 id="1-Turn-On-the-Chat-History-Training-Data"><a href="#1-Turn-On-the-Chat-History-Training-Data" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn On the Chat History &amp; Training Data"></a>1. Turn On the Chat History &amp; Training Data</h2><p> ChatGPT will save your previous conversations by default, so you can access them anytime. Now, if you or someone else accidentally disabled the feature, ChatGPT will no longer save any new conversations and delete the chat history.</p><p> To avoid this from happening again, you should turn on the <strong>Chat history &amp; training</strong> feature.</p><p> Head to ChatGPT and click the <strong>three-dot</strong> icon next to your username, followed by <strong>Settings</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Data controls</strong>. Hit the toggle next to <strong>Chat history &amp; training</strong> so that ChatGPT will save your conversations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-history-1.jpg"                      alt="Save your conversations on ChatGPT"                ></p><p> You should know that this setting doesn’t sync across multiple devices or browsers. So if you use ChatGPT on more than one browser or device, you’ll have to enable the feature for each one.</p><h2 id="2-Check-Your-Network-Connection"><a href="#2-Check-Your-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="2. Check Your Network Connection"></a>2. Check Your Network Connection</h2><p> There’s a chance you can’t access older ChatGPT conversations due to a faulty internet connection. So, check if your device is connected to the internet or try restarting your router.</p><p> If you still can’t figure out what’s wrong with your internet connection, check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-internet-connection/" >how to fix your internet connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Delete-Browser-Cache"><a href="#3-Delete-Browser-Cache" class="headerlink" title="3.

Delete Browser Cache</h2><p> When dealing with a website malfunction, you should try <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/" >deleting the browser cache and cookies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This works well because it stops your computer from using old forms, which may not be removed even if you update your browser.</p><p> After you’ve deleted the browser cache, you might notice websites loading a bit slower. This is because your browser is rebuilding the cache, which shouldn’t take long.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Use-a-Different-Browser"><a href="#4-Use-a-Different-Browser" class="headerlink" title="4. Use a Different Browser"></a>4. Use a Different Browser</h2><p> ChatGPT’s inability to save your conversation might be limited to your browser. To test it, switch to another browser. If ChatGPT is working as usual, you’ll have to fix your default browser.</p><p> Try to launch ChatGPT in Incognito or Private Mode to figure out if one of the browser extensions is causing the issue. Also, you might be dealing with improper site settings. In this case, you should reset your browser to its default settings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Access-ChatGPT-Through-a-Shared-Link"><a href="#5-Access-ChatGPT-Through-a-Shared-Link" class="headerlink" title="5.
