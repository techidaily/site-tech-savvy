In the rush of this daily routine, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool. Follow these tips to use ChatGPT to streamline your social media writing workflow.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Provide-Context-for-Your-Work"><a href="#1-Provide-Context-for-Your-Work" class="headerlink" title="1. Provide Context for Your Work"></a>1. Provide Context for Your Work</h2><p> When engaging ChatGPT for social media writing, provide as much context as possible to get the best results. Outline your desired outcomes, identify the platform you’re writing for, describe your target audience, and specify the tone of voice that suits your brand.</p><p> A clear vision will help ChatGPT align its assistance with your specific needs. If you have any unique requirements or guidelines, communicate them clearly in simple words to ensure ChatGPT’s responses align with your brand identity.</p><p> Here’s a sample prompt to generate a social media calendar and captions for a fictional graphic design agency:</p><p> Client [X] runs a design agency. They offer graphic design services for a subscription. The challenge is that only a few subscribers are requesting their services. Client [X] wants to remind their subscribers that they can utilize their subscription for design services.</p><p><strong>Strategy</strong>: Offer free social media templates with different themes to remind subscribers to avail of their services.</p><p><strong>Brand Voice</strong>: casual, conversational, simple</p><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Instagram and Facebook</p><p> Given this scenario, I will ask you to create the following:</p><p> 1. Different themes for the social media templates</p><p> 2. One-week content calendar</p><p> 3. Corresponding social media captions for the content calendar.</p><p> read more</p><p> In less than two minutes, ChatGPT developed ideas for social media templates accompanied by specific captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-05t164415-546.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt answers requests for social media templates"                ></p><h2 id="2-Refine-ChatGPT’s-Responses-to-Focus-on-Key-Information"><a href="#2-Refine-ChatGPT’s-Responses-to-Focus-on-Key-Information" class="headerlink" title="2.

Refine ChatGPT’s Responses to Focus on Key Information</h2><p> Overdependence is one of the biggest <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mistakes-to-avoid-using-chatgpt-content-creation/" >mistakes to avoid when using ChatGPT for content creation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. ChatGPT’s responses are raw information. They serve as a starting point that you can infuse with your creativity. Refine the AI-generated content by adding your unique touch or filling in the gaps, ensuring the copy resonates with your audience.</p><p> For instance, one of ChatGPT’s ideas was to share an inspirational quote template. You can mention the specific designer and use hashtags to personalize the idea.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-05t165217-538.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt generates motivational quotes as social media captions"                ></p><p> ChatGPT’s original caption was: “Midweek blues? Here’s a dose of motivation to keep you going. Customize it with our design subscription!”</p><p> With a slight tweak, you can edit this to: “Midweek blues? Here’s a dose of motivation from our favorite designer, Saul Bass! Customize it with our design subscription! [link to offer] #DesignWithUs”</p><h2 id="3-Don’t-Stop-at-the-First-Respone"><a href="#3-Don’t-Stop-at-the-First-Respone" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Stop at the First Respone"></a>3. Don’t Stop at the First Respone</h2><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-ideas-to-improve-content-creative-projects/" >use ChatGPT to improve your creative projects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by engaging in a dialogue with the AI. Ask follow-up questions, seek clarifications, and provide feedback on its responses. This interaction enhances the quality of your content and helps ChatGPT understand your preferences.</p><p> Asking questions and giving additional instructions can help refine ChatGPT results. You can also regenerate answers in ChatGPT. If you’re unsatisfied with the results or forgot to add a detail to your original prompt, you can simply continue the conversation, or you can regenerate the answer after making edits to the prompt.</p><p> For example, you may have realized that you wanted your captions to sound fun and witty. Instruct ChatGPT to make the captions fun and witty, then refine its answers afterward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-05t170221-043.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt creates fun and witty social media captions"                ></p><p> ChatGPT acts as your personal assistant, handling minor administrative tasks. By continuously interacting with ChatGPT, you can enjoy the benefits of more efficient and faster workflows in your social media team.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Be-Specific-With-Your-Instructions"><a href="#4-Be-Specific-With-Your-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="4.

The prompt we used was: “Revise the captions by considering the following brand guidelines [insert brand guidelines].”</p><p> Adding the brand voice in the instructions gave us results that suited the brand’s communication style so that the new social media posts would be consistent with previous postings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657395/16446" target="_top" id="1657395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657395/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Experiment-With-Prompts"><a href="#5-Experiment-With-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="5.

Try various wordings and instructions from other sources to compare the results.</p><p> For example, a simple prompt like “Give me fresh ideas for my Facebook posts on graphic design” will generate different results from “Give me fresh ideas for my Facebook posts on graphic design. What details do you need from me so you can come up with the best results?”</p><p> The first prompt will give you general ideas for social media posts on graphic design. The answers are a good starting point if you have writer’s block and need help with brainstorming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-05t171215-122.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt gives ideas for facebook posts"                ></p><p> The second prompt will generate a list of additional information that ChatGPT needs to tailor the results to your specific graphic design niche and audience.

TruthGPT, an AI chatbot proposed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is generating a lot of buzz online.But what is TruthGPT? Why does Elon Musk want to create it? And how will it be different from the AI tools we already have?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-TruthGPT"><a href="#What-Is-TruthGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is TruthGPT?"></a>What Is TruthGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/artificial-intelligence.jpg"                      alt="Man Holding Artificial Intelligence Sticky Note"                ></p><p> TruthGPT is a proposed AI model aimed at addressing the ills of existing models that powers the likes of ChatGPT and Bard, with particular emphasis on truth and safety. According to Elon Musk, TruthGPT will be a “maximum truth-seeking” AI that understands the nature of the universe and would be unlikely to destroy humanity because it sees humans as a critical component of the universe.</p><p> Maximum truth-seeking AI? Understand the nature of the universe?</p><p> You’ll be forgiven if Musk’s description doesn’t give you a clear picture of what exactly he’s trying to build. However, you’ll get a better idea of what he’s talking about by looking at why he’s trying to build it in the first place.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-Elon-Musk-Building-TruthGPT"><a href="#Why-Is-Elon-Musk-Building-TruthGPT" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Elon Musk Building TruthGPT?"></a>Why Is Elon Musk Building TruthGPT?</h2><p> In an interview with <a class="link"   href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/elon-musk-develop-truthgpt-warns-civilizational-destruction-ai" >Fox News <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Elon Musk expressed his concerns about how big AI firms can perpetuate bias and disinformation through AI chatbots—an emerging tool people increasingly depend on for information. Elon Musk also commented on the threat AI poses to humanity, emphasizing the possibility of an AI apocalypse, a scenario where AI systems could take control of our daily lives.</p><p> Singling out companies like OpenAI and Google, who, in his view, are not doing enough in the areas of AI safety and guarding against disinformation, Elon Musk proposed a third force—TruthGPT. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO wants to create TruthGPT as a counterweight to Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The idea is to create an AI model that tries as much as possible to be truthful in the information it provides.</p><p> Elon Musk, who recently authored an open letter calling for a <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/why-elon-musk-want-to-pause-ai-development/" >moratorium on the development of powerful AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models (specifically those more powerful than GPT-4), believes AI is moving too fast. He believes we need to slow down and reevaluate our approach to AI safety before AI “takes control.” TruthGPT is a large language model (LLM) that promises to address these two core concerns with today’s AI systems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Would-TruthGPT-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Would-TruthGPT-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Would TruthGPT Look Like?"></a>What Would TruthGPT Look Like?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mou-article-banner.jpg"                      alt="artificial brain doing data analytics"                ></p><p> The first hint into how TruthGPT would look is in the name. Considering the “GPT” appendage, TruthGPT will likely have a similar architecture to ChatGPT. Remember, Elon Musk helped assemble OpenAI and the team that built ChatGPT’s GPT model.</p><p> Also, considering GPT’s architecture has proven to be both a technical and commercial success, pursuing a different path will likely be too time-consuming and costly. Time is one thing that Elon Musk doesn’t have if he’s to build something that can truly stand toe to toe with state-of-the-art AI as soon as possible. So, don’t get too hyped—TruthGPT might not be that radically different from the AI tools we already have.</p><p> The accuracy, or in Elon Musk’s lingo, “truthfulness,” of an AI model depends heavily on its training data and the training algorithm. We are not exactly sure how TruthGPT’s training data would be sourced, but to get the best chance of building an LLM that’s as “truthful” as possible, Elon Musk’s TruthGPT would have to prioritize data from “truthful sources.” But that’s precisely the problem. Truth is a very subjective concept. What is true for me might not be true for you.</p><p> So, is this idea of a maximum truth-seeking AI even practical?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Building-TruthGPT-Is-a-Huge-Challenge"><a href="#Why-Building-TruthGPT-Is-a-Huge-Challenge" class="headerlink" title="Why Building TruthGPT Is a Huge Challenge"></a>Why Building TruthGPT Is a Huge Challenge</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-pixabay-159298.jpg"                      alt="Cogs on a machine"                ></p><p> Once you <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >understand how large language models like GPT work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it becomes clear that it is impractical to be correct at all times. Typically trained on a large dataset of internet data, a lot of it is, predictably, going to be false information, and LLM’s have no inert way of telling fact from fiction.</p><p> The best intervention is typically from human trainers who try to teach the language model what’s good behavior and what’s bad. But human trainers are biased. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-bias/" >Bias is passed to the AI models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, defeating the whole purpose of a “maximum truth-seeking AI.” Note, we’re not talking about outright bias or prejudice against a people or otherwise. It’s the more subtle bias about how you interpret language, situations, challenges, and so on that leach into the process. Humans are human, after all.</p><p> Of course, accuracy can also be tackled from the algorithm side. However, irrespective of the algorithm, language ambiguity still represents a big problem for the accuracy of AI models. Even humans often struggle to accurately interpret a sentence or phrase’s meaning, leading to misinformation. For AI models, ambiguity can lead to misinterpretations resulting in inaccuracies.</p><p> For Musk, TruthGPT appears to be a chance for him to carve an AI model that he sees fit to deliver the truth. How that would come about without introducing his own biases is another question entirely and effectively leads us back to the start of the conversation. How are Musk’s opinions on what is biased or not any different from those who trained and directed ChatGPT?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657386/16446" target="_top" id="1657386">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657386" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657386/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-TruthGPT-an-Exciting-Possibility"><a href="#Is-TruthGPT-an-Exciting-Possibility" class="headerlink" title="Is TruthGPT an Exciting Possibility?"></a>Is TruthGPT an Exciting Possibility?</h2><p> Elon Musk’s plans for TruthGPT seem noble and commendable.

In this article, we compare our top two choices: NordVPN and Surfshark. </p><h2 id="Aren’t-they-the-same-company"><a href="#Aren’t-they-the-same-company" class="headerlink" title="Aren’t they the same company?"></a>Aren’t they the same company?</h2><p>Before we get into it, let’s discuss the Nord&#x2F;Surfshark merger. In early February 2022, Nord Security and Surfshark <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordvpn-and-surfshark-announce-merger/" >announced they were merging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, making Nord Security the owner of both companies. According to SurfShark’s merger <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://surfshark.com/blog/surfshark-merges-with-nord-security" >blog post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the companies plan to continue operating as separate companies with separate VPN infrastructures. </p><p>We have no doubt this is true – for now. Merging large infrastructures takes time, and neither player wants to cede performance or position to their competitors due to a botched operational merger. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/" >The best VPN services: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That said, we don’t expect this to remain the case in the long term. The merger was not unexpected given the upward trend of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordvpn-and-surfshark-announce-merger/" >VPN mergers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Plus, these VPN powerhouses would be foolish not to consolidate infrastructures, teams, and technologies – and these players are anything but foolish. </p><p>In the interim, you’re here choosing between the two separate VPN options, and our overview content below remains relevant. </p><p>So, let’s dive in. </p><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><p>Both VPNs offer similar support and almost identical services. The key differences, as we’ll discuss, revolve around price and extended feature set. </p><table><thead><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Surfshark</th><th>NordVPN</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Servers</td><td>3,200+</td><td>6,000+</td></tr><tr><td>Countries</td><td>100+</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Simultaneous connections</td><td>unlimited</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Ad blocker</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Malware scanner</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Kill switch</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Logging</td><td>Email address</td><td>Email address and billing info</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-hop</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Best price</td><td>$59.13 for 27 months ($2.19&#x2F;month)</td><td>$99.63 for two years ($3.69&#x2F;month)</td></tr><tr><td>Trial&#x2F;MBG</td><td>30-day refund guarantee</td><td>30-day refund guarantee</td></tr><tr><td>Supported platforms</td><td>iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux</td><td>iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux</td></tr><tr><td>Additional support for</td><td>FireTV, Smart TVs (Apple TV, Android TV, Roku, Chromecast), Router, Xbox, PlayStation</td><td>Router, FireStick, Xbox, PlayStation, Oculus Quest, Kindle Fire, Nintendo Switch, Raspberry Pi, Chromebook, Chromecast, Android TV</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="You-should-get-Surfshark-if…"><a href="#You-should-get-Surfshark-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should get Surfshark if…"></a>You should get Surfshark if…</h2><p>(Image: Surfshark)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-You-want-to-save-a-few-bucks"><a href="#1-You-want-to-save-a-few-bucks" class="headerlink" title="1.

Prices change regularly, but at the time of writing, <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://get.surfshark.net/aff%255Fc?offer%255Fid=786&aff%255Fid=1511" >Surfshark is about $30 less <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over two years, or about a buck less per month. There are some performance differences for this price savings, though. Read on for why you might want to buy NordVPN if a performance edge matters to you. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-You-want-to-use-more-than-10-simultaneous-devices"><a href="#2-You-want-to-use-more-than-10-simultaneous-devices" class="headerlink" title="2. You want to use more than 10 simultaneous devices"></a>2. You want to use more than 10 simultaneous devices</h2><p>NordVPN allows you to connect 10 devices at once to its VPN service. Surfshark sets no limits at all. If you’re traveling with just a few devices, that won’t matter much. If you’re at home or in the office, however, the device count can add up. </p><p>Now, I’ll admit I’m a bit of an outlier, but I switch between four main computers, a few spare machines, three iPads, my phone, and a bunch of console games and smart TVs. With unlimited simultaneous connections, I don’t have to worry about how many machines are connected to the internet. Surfshark lets you do whatever you need to do.</p><h2 id="3-You-want-ad-free-protected-searches-plus-antivirus-and-breach-alerts"><a href="#3-You-want-ad-free-protected-searches-plus-antivirus-and-breach-alerts" class="headerlink" title="3. You want ad-free protected searches plus antivirus and breach alerts"></a>3. You want ad-free protected searches plus antivirus and breach alerts</h2><p>Surfshark has a $1.49&#x2F;month upsell (because, of course it does) called Surfshark One. This adds what the company calls an “ad-free lightweight search engine” that doesn’t keep any search records. Surfshark One also includes an antivirus engine and breach alerts, but those are available from NordVPN, too. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://get.surfshark.net/aff%255Fc?offer%255Fid=50&aff%255Fid=1511&source=ZDNET&aff%255Fsub=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >Surfshark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-get-NordVPN-if…"><a href="#You-should-get-NordVPN-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should get NordVPN if…"></a>You should get NordVPN if…</h2><h2 id="1-You-want-predictably-fast-download-performance"><a href="#1-You-want-predictably-fast-download-performance" class="headerlink" title="1.

We compared VPN rankings in speed tests from 10 sites besides ZDNET. </p><p>To help us determine whether a VPN has a consistent ranking, or if different reviewers were getting distinctly different numbers, we compared the standard deviation of the 10 other sites.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/" >How we test VPNs in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>As the above slide shows, <a class="link"   href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?offer_id=378&aff_id=307&source=ZDNET&aff_sub=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&aff_sub2=nordvpnvssurfshark" >NordVPN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> not only had a better aggregate average ranking but also a considerably lower standard deviation. This means that pretty much wherever you are, your NordVPN performance should be pretty good. By contrast, how Surfshark will perform is likely to be far less predictable. </p><h2 id="2-You-want-a-cheaper-upsell-for-antimalware-and-adware-protection"><a href="#2-You-want-a-cheaper-upsell-for-antimalware-and-adware-protection" class="headerlink" title="2. You want a cheaper upsell for antimalware and adware protection"></a>2. You want a cheaper upsell for antimalware and adware protection</h2><p>Surfshark starts off less expensive, but if you want malware protection and adware blocking, you have to upgrade to the Surfshark One program. Those features used to be included in the basic NordVPN plan, but now cost a buck extra. So, while you’re saving a buck per month on Surfshark, you’re paying $1.50 per month more for those added features. Net-net, the pricing for these two services is very close. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-and-remove-spyware-from-your-phone/" >How to find and remove spyware from your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Wait, there’s more… to buy. (Because, of course, NordVPN also has upsells.) You can spend another dollar per month and get Nord’s password manager and breach-alert tracker. If you pay yet another buck per month, you can get a terabyte of encrypted cloud storage. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062447/7443" target="_top" id="1062447">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062447" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062447/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-You-want-business-oriented-features-or-fixed-IP"><a href="#3-You-want-business-oriented-features-or-fixed-IP" class="headerlink" title="3.

You want business-oriented features or fixed IP</h2><p>NordVPN offers full business plans with team management, admin consoles, and everything you’d need to deploy a VPN for a full company or department. If you don’t want all the business and team management features of an enterprise VPN, and you just want a fixed IP to run a server or for remote access, that’s available for an additional $3.69&#x2F;month. Just be aware that it’s not available at all locations, so check the available locations before signing up. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?offer_id=378&aff_id=307&source=ZDNET&aff_sub=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&aff_sub2=nordvpnvssurfshark" >NordVPN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There you go. <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://get.surfshark.net/aff%255Fc?aff%255Fsub=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp&aff%255Fid=1511&source=ZDNET&offer%255Fid=786" >Surfshark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> vs. <a class="link"   href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?aff_sub=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp&aff_id=307&source=ZDNET&offer_id=378" >NordVPN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Every website, at minimum, records an IP address, time, and data accessed so they can track traffic. </p><p>All VPN providers have to check credentials against recorded personal data to make sure you paid, but a few let you sign up with Bitcoin, allowing you to completely hide your identity. </p><p>When we say a VPN doesn’t log data, we mean they don’t track what sites you visit and for how long, but they may track how much of their infrastructure you use.</p><h2 id="What-do-simultaneous-connections-mean-and-why-should-I-care"><a href="#What-do-simultaneous-connections-mean-and-why-should-I-care" class="headerlink" title="What do simultaneous connections mean and why should I care?"></a>What do simultaneous connections mean and why should I care?</h2><p>I’ll give you a personal example. When I travel, I often take my laptop and my tablet. I use the laptop to write, and I use the tablet as a second screen to look stuff up. I have two connections I’m using at once, and I want my VPN to protect both. If my wife is doing the same thing, that’s four connections. Add our phones, and you have six connections. If we’re using all those devices at once, that’s simultaneous connections. The more connections supported, the better.</p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Creativity"></a>1. Creativity</h3><p> To test its creativity and sense of humor, we gave it our signature creativity and sarcasm test. We asked the Llama 2 AI model to simulate a conversation between two people arguing about the merits of going to space, and here are the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hugging-face-llama-sarcastic-argument-about-space.jpg"                      alt="Hugging face LlaMA Sarcastic argument about space"                ></p><p> Followed by:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hugging-face-llama-sarcastic-argument-about-space-2.jpg"                      alt="Hugging face LlaMA Sarcastic argument about space 2"                ></p><p> And finally:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hugging-face-llama-sarcastic-argument-about-space-3.jpg"                      alt="Hugging face LlaMA Sarcastic argument about space 3"                ></p><p> Judging from the results of our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-vs-google-bard/" >comparison of ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where we also used the same test, only ChatGPT’s response is noticeably better than Llama 2’s response. Llama 2’s response seems to be fairly better than Google’s Bard. After putting the chatbots through several creative tasks, it’s clear that ChatGPT is still the top dog in terms of creativity, but Llama is not far behind the rest of the pack.</p><h3 id="2-Coding-Skills"><a href="#2-Coding-Skills" class="headerlink" title="2. Coding Skills"></a>2. Coding Skills</h3><p> When we compared Llama 2’s coding abilities to ChatGPT and Bard, Llama 2 showed great promise. We asked all three AI chatbots to generate a functional to-do list app, write a simple Tetris game, and create a secure authentication system for a website. While ChatGPT delivered almost perfectly on all three tasks, Bard and Llama 2 performed similarly, with both only able to provide functional code for a to-do list and authentication system but failed with the Tetris game. Below is a screenshot of Llama 2’s to-do app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/todo-app-created-by-llama-2.jpg"                      alt="todo app created by Llama 2"                ></p><h3 id="3-Math-Skills"><a href="#3-Math-Skills" class="headerlink" title="3. Math Skills"></a>3. Math Skills</h3><p> In math skills, Llama 2 also showed promise compared to Bard but was far outperformed by ChatGPT in the algebra and logic math problems we used for our test. Interestingly, Llama 2 solved many of the math problems that both ChatGPT and Bard failed to solve in their earliest iterations. It’s safe to say that Llama 2 is inferior to ChatGPT in math skills but shows significant promise.</p><h3 id="4-Commonsense-and-Logical-Reasoning"><a href="#4-Commonsense-and-Logical-Reasoning" class="headerlink" title="4. Commonsense and Logical Reasoning"></a>4. Commonsense and Logical Reasoning</h3><p> Commonsense is an area a lot of chatbots are still struggling with, even the established ones like ChatGPT. We tasked ChatGPT, Bard, and Llama 2 with solving a set of commonsense and logical reasoning problems. Once again, ChatGPT significantly exceeded both Bard and Llama 2. The competition was between Bard and Llama 2, and Bard had a marginal edge over Llama 2 in our test.</p><p> It’s clear that Llama 2 is not there yet. However, in its defense, Llama 2 is relatively new, mostly a “foundational model” and not a “fine-tune.” Foundational models are large language models built with possible future adaptations in mind. They are not fine-tuned to any specific domain but are built to deal with a broad range of tasks, although sometimes with limited abilities.</p><p> On the other hand, a fine-tuned model is a foundational model tuned to increase its efficiency in a specific domain. It’s like taking a foundational model like GPT and fine-tuning it into ChatGPT so the public can use it in chat applications.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Llama-2-Right-Now"><a href="#How-to-Use-Llama-2-Right-Now" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Llama 2 Right Now"></a>How to Use Llama 2 Right Now</h2><p> The easiest way to use Llama 2 is through Quora’s Poe AI platform or a Hugging Face cloud-hosted instance. You can also get your hands on the model by downloading a copy of it and running it locally.</p><h3 id="Access-Llama-on-Quora-Poe"><a href="#Access-Llama-on-Quora-Poe" class="headerlink" title="Access Llama on Quora Poe"></a>Access Llama on Quora Poe</h3><p> To access Llama on Quora’s Poe AI platform:</p><ol><li>Visit <a class="link"   href="https://poe.com/login" >poe.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and sign up for a free account.</li><li>Log into your account to reveal the AI model selection interface.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/poe-com-chat-interface.jpg"                      alt="Poe.com chat interface"                ></li><li>Click on the <strong>More</strong> icon just above the input field to reveal the available AI models.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/selecting-a-model-on-quora-s-poe-com.jpg"                      alt="Selecting a model on Quora&#39;s poe.com"                ></li></ol><p> Choose any of the Llama 2 models available and start prompting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Access-Llama-on-Hugging-Face"><a href="#Access-Llama-on-Hugging-Face" class="headerlink" title="Access Llama on Hugging Face"></a>Access Llama on Hugging Face</h3><p> To access Llama on Hugging Face, open the link to the corresponding Llama 2 models below and start prompting the AI chatbot.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/llama-2-7b-chat" >7B parameters Llama-2 chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/llama-2-13b-chat" >13B parameters Llama-2 chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Explore%5Fllamav2%5Fwith%5FTGI" >70B parameters Llama-2 chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ol><p> The Llama models above and those on the Poe platform have been fine-tuned for conversation applications, so it is the closest to ChatGPT you’ll get for a Llama-2 model. Not sure which version to try? We recommend option three, the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Explore%5Fllamav2%5Fwith%5FTGI" >70B parameters Llama-2 chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can still play around with all three models to see which one works best for your unique needs.</p><p> Although we advise starting with the largest available model to take full advantage of the remote computing power when using HuggingFace or Poe, for those intending to run Llama 2 locally, we encourage beginning with the 7B parameter model, as it has the lowest hardware requirements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hardware-Requirements-to-Run-Llama-2-Locally"><a href="#Hardware-Requirements-to-Run-Llama-2-Locally" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Requirements to Run Llama 2 Locally"></a>Hardware Requirements to Run Llama 2 Locally</h2><p> For optimal performance with the 7B model, we recommend a graphics card with at least 10GB of VRAM, although people have reported it works with 8GB of RAM. When running locally, the next logical choice would be the 13B parameter model. For this, you can go for high-end consumer GPUs like the RTX 3090 or RTX 4090 to enjoy their abilities. However, you can still rig up your mid-tier Windows machine or a MacBook to run this.</p><p> Should you want to go full throttle, you can go for the largest model. However, this will require enterprise-grade hardware for a blissful performance. By enterprise-grade, we are talking hardware in the ballpark of an NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of memory. The 70B parameter model requires exceptionally powerful, specialized hardware for responsive execution. Once again, clarifying that you can still run this model on a less powerful machine setup is important. However, response time might be agonizingly slow, running into several minutes per prompt. Carefully consider the GPU and memory requirements before selecting the appropriate model for your needs. Or, use the HuggingFace instance.</p><p> If you have the hardware and technical depth to run the Llama 2 model locally on your machine, you can request access to the model using <a class="link"   href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/" >Meta’s Llama access request form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. After providing a name, email, location, and the name of your organization, Meta will review your application, after which access will either be denied or granted access within a window spanning a few minutes to two days. My access was granted in minutes, so hopefully, you get lucky as well.</p><h2 id="Llama-2-An-Important-First-Step"><a href="#Llama-2-An-Important-First-Step" class="headerlink" title="Llama 2: An Important First Step"></a>Llama 2: An Important First Step</h2><p> Llama 2 may not be the most sophisticated language model available, but by virtue of being open source, it represents an important first step towards transparent and progressive AI development.</p><p> While the likes of OpenAI GPT currently have better performance, OpenAI’s walled-garden approach to development means the company controls the growth and pace of development of the model. With an open-source model like Llama, the wider open-source community can iteratively innovate to build new products that might not be possible within a walled garden system.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> From OpenAI’s GPT-4 to Google’s PalM 2, large language models dominate tech headlines.

Not sure which version to try? We recommend option three, the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Explore%5Fllamav2%5Fwith%5FTGI" >70B parameters Llama-2 chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can still play around with all three models to see which one works best for your unique needs.</p><p> Although we advise starting with the largest available model to take full advantage of the remote computing power when using HuggingFace or Poe, for those intending to run Llama 2 locally, we encourage beginning with the 7B parameter model, as it has the lowest hardware requirements.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Requirements-to-Run-Llama-2-Locally-1"><a href="#Hardware-Requirements-to-Run-Llama-2-Locally-1" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Requirements to Run Llama 2 Locally"></a>Hardware Requirements to Run Llama 2 Locally</h2><p> For optimal performance with the 7B model, we recommend a graphics card with at least 10GB of VRAM, although people have reported it works with 8GB of RAM. When running locally, the next logical choice would be the 13B parameter model. For this, you can go for high-end consumer GPUs like the RTX 3090 or RTX 4090 to enjoy their abilities. However, you can still rig up your mid-tier Windows machine or a MacBook to run this.</p><p> Should you want to go full throttle, you can go for the largest model. However, this will require enterprise-grade hardware for a blissful performance. By enterprise-grade, we are talking hardware in the ballpark of an NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of memory. The 70B parameter model requires exceptionally powerful, specialized hardware for responsive execution. Once again, clarifying that you can still run this model on a less powerful machine setup is important. However, response time might be agonizingly slow, running into several minutes per prompt. Carefully consider the GPU and memory requirements before selecting the appropriate model for your needs. Or, use the HuggingFace instance.</p><p> If you have the hardware and technical depth to run the Llama 2 model locally on your machine, you can request access to the model using <a class="link"   href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/" >Meta’s Llama access request form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. After providing a name, email, location, and the name of your organization, Meta will review your application, after which access will either be denied or granted access within a window spanning a few minutes to two days. My access was granted in minutes, so hopefully, you get lucky as well.</p><h2 id="Llama-2-An-Important-First-Step-1"><a href="#Llama-2-An-Important-First-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Llama 2: An Important First Step"></a>Llama 2: An Important First Step</h2><p> Llama 2 may not be the most sophisticated language model available, but by virtue of being open source, it represents an important first step towards transparent and progressive AI development.</p><p> While the likes of OpenAI GPT currently have better performance, OpenAI’s walled-garden approach to development means the company controls the growth and pace of development of the model. With an open-source model like Llama, the wider open-source community can iteratively innovate to build new products that might not be possible within a walled garden system.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> From OpenAI’s GPT-4 to Google’s PalM 2, large language models dominate tech headlines. Each new model promises to be better and more powerful than the previous, sometimes exceeding any existing competition.</p><p> However, the number of existing models hasn’t slowed the emergence of new ones. Now, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has released Llama 2, a powerful new language model. But what’s unique about Llama 2? How is it different from the likes of GPT-4, PaLM 2, and Claude 2, and why should you care?</p><h2 id="What-Is-Llama-2-2"><a href="#What-Is-Llama-2-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Llama 2?"></a>What Is Llama 2?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/llama-illustration.jpg"                      alt="Llama illustration"                ></p><p> Llama 2, a large language model, is a product of an uncommon alliance between Meta and Microsoft, two competing tech giants at the forefront of artificial intelligence research. It is a successor to Meta’s Llama 1 language model, released in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p> You can say it is Meta’s equivalent of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-palm-2/" >Google’s PaLM 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OpenAIs GPT-4, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-2-what-can-you-do-with-it/" >Anthropic’s Claude 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It has been trained on a vast dataset of publicly available internet data, enjoying the advantage of a dataset both more recent and more diverse than that used to train Llama 1. Llama 2 was trained with 40% more data than its predecessor and has double the context length (4k).</p><p> If you’ve had the opportunity to interact with Llama 1 in the past but weren’t too impressed with its output, Llama 2 outperforms its predecessor and might just be what you need. But how does it fare against outside competition?</p><h2 id="How-Does-Llama-2-Stack-Up-Against-The-Competition-2"><a href="#How-Does-Llama-2-Stack-Up-Against-The-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="How Does Llama 2 Stack Up Against The Competition?"></a>How Does Llama 2 Stack Up Against The Competition?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jpg_20230401_123755_0000.jpg"                      alt="Illustration of ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard"                ></p><p> Well, it depends on the competition it is up against. Firstly, Llama 2 is an open-source project. This means Meta is publishing the entire model, so anyone can use it to build new models or applications. If you compare Llama 2 to other major open-source language models like Falcon or MBT, you will find it outperforms them in several metrics. It is safe to say Llama 2 is one of the most powerful open-source <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the market today.

Each new model promises to be better and more powerful than the previous, sometimes exceeding any existing competition.</p><p> However, the number of existing models hasn’t slowed the emergence of new ones. Now, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has released Llama 2, a powerful new language model. But what’s unique about Llama 2? How is it different from the likes of GPT-4, PaLM 2, and Claude 2, and why should you care?</p><h2 id="What-Is-Llama-2-3"><a href="#What-Is-Llama-2-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Llama 2?"></a>What Is Llama 2?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/llama-illustration.jpg"                      alt="Llama illustration"                ></p><p> Llama 2, a large language model, is a product of an uncommon alliance between Meta and Microsoft, two competing tech giants at the forefront of artificial intelligence research. It is a successor to Meta’s Llama 1 language model, released in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p> You can say it is Meta’s equivalent of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-palm-2/" >Google’s PaLM 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OpenAIs GPT-4, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-2-what-can-you-do-with-it/" >Anthropic’s Claude 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It has been trained on a vast dataset of publicly available internet data, enjoying the advantage of a dataset both more recent and more diverse than that used to train Llama 1. Llama 2 was trained with 40% more data than its predecessor and has double the context length (4k).</p><p> If you’ve had the opportunity to interact with Llama 1 in the past but weren’t too impressed with its output, Llama 2 outperforms its predecessor and might just be what you need. But how does it fare against outside competition?</p><h2 id="How-Does-Llama-2-Stack-Up-Against-The-Competition-3"><a href="#How-Does-Llama-2-Stack-Up-Against-The-Competition-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does Llama 2 Stack Up Against The Competition?"></a>How Does Llama 2 Stack Up Against The Competition?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jpg_20230401_123755_0000.jpg"                      alt="Illustration of ChatGPT vs. Bing AI vs. Bard"                ></p><p> Well, it depends on the competition it is up against. Firstly, Llama 2 is an open-source project. This means Meta is publishing the entire model, so anyone can use it to build new models or applications. If you compare Llama 2 to other major open-source language models like Falcon or MBT, you will find it outperforms them in several metrics. It is safe to say Llama 2 is one of the most powerful open-source <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the market today. But How does it stack up against juggernauts like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s PalM line of AI models?</p><p> We assessed ChatGPT, Bard, and Llama 2 on their performance on tests of creativity, mathematical reasoning, practical judgment, and coding skills.</p><h3 id="1-Creativity-3"><a href="#1-Creativity-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Creativity"></a>1. Creativity</h3><p> To test its creativity and sense of humor, we gave it our signature creativity and sarcasm test. We asked the Llama 2 AI model to simulate a conversation between two people arguing about the merits of going to space, and here are the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hugging-face-llama-sarcastic-argument-about-space.jpg"                      alt="Hugging face LlaMA Sarcastic argument about space"                ></p><p> Followed by:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hugging-face-llama-sarcastic-argument-about-space-2.jpg"                      alt="Hugging face LlaMA Sarcastic argument about space 2"                ></p><p> And finally:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hugging-face-llama-sarcastic-argument-about-space-3.jpg"                      alt="Hugging face LlaMA Sarcastic argument about space 3"                ></p><p> Judging from the results of our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-vs-google-bard/" >comparison of ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where we also used the same test, only ChatGPT’s response is noticeably better than Llama 2’s response. Llama 2’s response seems to be fairly better than Google’s Bard. After putting the chatbots through several creative tasks, it’s clear that ChatGPT is still the top dog in terms of creativity, but Llama is not far behind the rest of the pack.</p><h3 id="2-Coding-Skills-3"><a href="#2-Coding-Skills-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Coding Skills"></a>2. Coding Skills</h3><p> When we compared Llama 2’s coding abilities to ChatGPT and Bard, Llama 2 showed great promise. We asked all three AI chatbots to generate a functional to-do list app, write a simple Tetris game, and create a secure authentication system for a website. While ChatGPT delivered almost perfectly on all three tasks, Bard and Llama 2 performed similarly, with both only able to provide functional code for a to-do list and authentication system but failed with the Tetris game. Below is a screenshot of Llama 2’s to-do app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/todo-app-created-by-llama-2.jpg"                      alt="todo app created by Llama 2"                ></p><h3 id="3-Math-Skills-3"><a href="#3-Math-Skills-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Math Skills"></a>3. Math Skills</h3><p> In math skills, Llama 2 also showed promise compared to Bard but was far outperformed by ChatGPT in the algebra and logic math problems we used for our test. Interestingly, Llama 2 solved many of the math problems that both ChatGPT and Bard failed to solve in their earliest iterations. It’s safe to say that Llama 2 is inferior to ChatGPT in math skills but shows significant promise.</p><h3 id="4-Commonsense-and-Logical-Reasoning-3"><a href="#4-Commonsense-and-Logical-Reasoning-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Commonsense and Logical Reasoning"></a>4. Commonsense and Logical Reasoning</h3><p> Commonsense is an area a lot of chatbots are still struggling with, even the established ones like ChatGPT. We tasked ChatGPT, Bard, and Llama 2 with solving a set of commonsense and logical reasoning problems. Once again, ChatGPT significantly exceeded both Bard and Llama 2. The competition was between Bard and Llama 2, and Bard had a marginal edge over Llama 2 in our test.</p><p> It’s clear that Llama 2 is not there yet. However, in its defense, Llama 2 is relatively new, mostly a “foundational model” and not a “fine-tune.” Foundational models are large language models built with possible future adaptations in mind. They are not fine-tuned to any specific domain but are built to deal with a broad range of tasks, although sometimes with limited abilities.</p><p> On the other hand, a fine-tuned model is a foundational model tuned to increase its efficiency in a specific domain. It’s like taking a foundational model like GPT and fine-tuning it into ChatGPT so the public can use it in chat applications.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Llama-2-Right-Now-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-Llama-2-Right-Now-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Llama 2 Right Now"></a>How to Use Llama 2 Right Now</h2><p> The easiest way to use Llama 2 is through Quora’s Poe AI platform or a Hugging Face cloud-hosted instance.

Mobile device repair specialists iFixit <a class="link"   href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82867/iphone-15-teardown-reveals-software-lockdown" >would later reveal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that repairability was held back a little by Apple’s DRM, but it appears the latest iPhone – the iPhone 16 – addresses those issues.</p><p>First up is a new way to remove the iPhone’s battery. The iPhone 15 and previous models used glue that was notoriously difficult to deal with, but the iPhone 16 has a special adhesive that loosens when you apply a low-voltage charge like a 9V battery, making it significantly easier and faster to remove. This glue is present on the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus, but not the Pro model.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/" >We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But even with all the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features we know about and considering that Apple will likely reserve new ones to announce during the September 9 event,</p><p>Also new is a Repair Assistant that is included with iOS 18. The feature is open to both repair professionals and regular consumers and allows them to configure parts – both new and used. Apple <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-to-expand-repair-options-with-support-for-used-genuine-parts/" >announced this feature in April <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, saying, “the new process is designed to maintain an iPhone user’s privacy, security, and safety, while offering consumers more options, increasing product longevity, and minimizing the environmental impact of a repair.” </p><p>Apple says used or third-party parts will have the same functionality and security as original ones.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>On-board diagnostics are coming too, letting customers know what part is malfunctioning. Previously, you would have needed another phone to run this tool.</p><p>Finally, Apple is making it easier to replace the Face ID sensor. Previously, only Apple could swap out this part, but now anyone can replace the TrueDepth Camera on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. <a class="link"   href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-how-its-made-the-iphone-16-series-much-easier-to-repair-120055256.html" >Engadget adds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the LiDAR scanner is now replaceable too.</p><p>Not only is Apple adding several tools for you to diagnose your phone problems on your own, but it’s significantly widening support for non-Apple parts.

There are probably millions of them crawling the billions of websites available on the internet today. And they have been around since at least the early 90s. GPTBot is just one of such crawlers owned by OpenAI. So, what’s causing the controversy around this particular web crawler?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Are-Big-Tech-Sites-Blocking-GPTBot"><a href="#Why-Are-Big-Tech-Sites-Blocking-GPTBot" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Big Tech Sites Blocking GPTBot?"></a>Why Are Big Tech Sites Blocking GPTBot?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/stop-sign-on-the-road-side.jpg"                      alt="stop sign on the road side"                ></p><p> According to <a class="link"   href="https://businessinsider.com/news/major-websites-like-amazon-and-the-new-york-times-are-increasingly-blocking-openais/knnp16k" >Business Insider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, some of the largest websites on the internet are actively blocking OpenAI’s crawler on their website. So, if the ultimate goal of GPTBot is to advance AI development, why are some of the biggest sites on the internet, some of which have benefited in one way or another from AI, against it?</p><p> Well, here’s the thing. Since the 2022 resurgence of generative AI technologies, there have been numerous debates on the right of AI companies to use, almost without limits, data sourced from the internet, a significant portion of which is legally protected by copyright. No clear laws govern how these companies collect and use data for their own gain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/artificial-intelligence-woman.jpg"                      alt="Artificial intelligence woman"                ></p><p> So, basically, crawlers like GPTBot crawl the web, grab people’s creative work in the form of text, images, or other forms of media, and use it for commercial purposes without obtaining any permission, licensing, or providing compensation to the original creators.</p><p> It’s a wild west out there, and AI companies are grabbing whatever they can get their hands on. Large websites like Quora, CNN, the New York Times, Business Insider, and Amazon are not very pleased that their copyrighted content is being harvested by these crawlers, so OpenAI can get financial benefit from it at their expense.</p><p> That’s why these sites are deploying “robots.txt,” a decades-old method to block web crawlers. According to <a class="link"   href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, GPTBot will obey instructions to crawl or avoid crawling websites based on the rules embedded in robots.txt, a small text file that tells web crawlers how to behave on a site. If you have a site of your own and would love to stop GPTBot from grabbing your data, here’s how you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/block-openai-crawlers-from-scraping-website/" >block OpenAI’s crawlers from scraping your website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Can-Websites-Really-Stop-GPTBot"><a href="#Can-Websites-Really-Stop-GPTBot" class="headerlink" title="Can Websites Really Stop GPTBot?"></a>Can Websites Really Stop GPTBot?</h2><p> While crawlers like GPTBot are indispensable for gathering the massive amounts of data required to train advanced AI systems, there are valid concerns around copyright and fair usage that cannot be ignored.</p><p> Sure, there are simple tools like robots.txt that can be used to guard against this, but whether GPTBot obeys the instructions on this file is entirely at OpenAI’s discretion. There are no guarantees that they will do so, and there is no immediate foolproof way to tell whether they’ve done so. In the fight to keep GPTBot away from copyrighted data, OpenAI holds the aces, at least for now.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> In August 2023, OpenAI, the AI powerhouse credited with developing ChatGPT, announced GPTBot, a web crawler designed to traverse the web and gather data.</p><p> Not long after that announcement, some of the biggest websites on the internet blocked the bot from accessing their website.

In the fight to keep GPTBot away from copyrighted data, OpenAI holds the aces, at least for now.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-pro-tips-to-amplify-your-canva-designs/"><u>[Updated] Pro Tips to Amplify Your Canva Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exquisite-stop-motion-cinema-top-15-picks/"><u>2024 Approved Exquisite Stop-Motion Cinema - Top 15 Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-melody-in-motion-iphones-role-in-making-music-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Melody in Motion IPhone's Role in Making Music Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-automation-enhancing-your-websites-engagement/"><u>Cookiebot-Driven Automation: Enhancing Your Website's Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-personalization-enhance-user-experience-with-smart-marketing/"><u>Cookiebot-Driven Personalization: Enhance User Experience with Smart Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enabled-enhance-your-sites-user-experience/"><u>Cookiebot-Enabled: Enhance Your Site's User Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enabled-enhance-your-website-traffic-and-conversions/"><u>Cookiebot-Enabled: Enhance Your Website Traffic and Conversions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enhanced-experience-streamlined-leads-and-analytics/"><u>Cookiebot-Enhanced Experience: Streamlined Leads & Analytics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enhanced-boosting-your-site-with-powerful-tracking-tools/"><u>Cookiebot-Enhanced: Boosting Your Site with Powerful Tracking Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enhanced-elevate-your-websites-personalization/"><u>Cookiebot-Enhanced: Elevate Your Website's Personalization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/cookiebot-fueled-performance-enhancing-digital-experiences/"><u>Cookiebot-Fueled Performance: Enhancing Digital Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/elevate-your-website-analytics-and-conversions-using-the-advanced-technology-of-cookiebot/"><u>Elevate Your Website Analytics and Conversions Using the Advanced Technology of Cookiebot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/expert-techniques-efficiently-collecting-photo-and-video-banners/"><u>Expert Techniques Efficiently Collecting Photo and Video Banners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/fix-your-apple-watch-connection-woes-with-these-6-simple-tips/"><u>Fix Your Apple Watch Connection Woes With These 6 Simple Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-xr-with-imei-code-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Apple iPhone XR with IMEI Code?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-quest-for-optimal-video-viewing-vlcs-stand-against-mpc/"><u>In 2024, The Quest for Optimal Video Viewing VLC's Stand Against MPC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-hacks.techidaily.com/locate-iphone-data-backup-files-in-windows-tips-for-win-111087-users/"><u>Locate iPhone Data Backup Files in Windows: Tips for Win. 11/10/8/7 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/surviving-blackouts-in-esports-apgs-top-picks-for-a-secure-and-stable-pc-power-source/"><u>Surviving Blackouts in Esports: APG's Top Picks for a Secure and Stable PC Power Source</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/tutorial-to-change-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tutorial to Change Samsung Galaxy F15 5G IMEI without Root A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Bing Showdown"></a>Exploring AI Potential: Bard Vs. Bing Showdown</h2><p> Google Bard was released shortly after Microsoft’s Bing Chat, and both tools are hoping to grab a healthy share of the burgeoning generative AI and integrated AI search market. But what are the differences between them? And which chatbot is right for you?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Are-the-Differences-between-Google-Bard-and-Bing-Chat"><a href="#What-Are-the-Differences-between-Google-Bard-and-Bing-Chat" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Differences between Google Bard and Bing Chat?"></a>What Are the Differences between Google Bard and Bing Chat?</h2><p> Outwardly, both tools look similar. They both offer a simple interface with a text box to allow you to “chat” with them. However, dig a little deeper, and significant differences become apparent. To test the tools for yourself, you will need a Google and Microsoft account, although you might have to join a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-join-google-bard-ai-waitlist/" >waitlist for Google Bard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> To compare Google Bard and Bing AI Chat, we derived a simple test. We used them to conduct research for an imaginary article on atmospheric CO2 levels and climate change. This enabled us to draw comparisons on several metrics, including the quality and size of the response, the accuracy of the data, and ease of use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137220/26400" target="_top" id="2137220">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137220" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137220/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Quality"><a href="#Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Quality"></a>Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Quality</h2><p> We began by asking both platforms an identical question: “How do modern-day CO2 levels compare to the last ice age?”</p><p> There were differences between how both models approached the question. First up, we will look at Google Bard’s answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-bard-responding-to-co2-levels.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot Bard Responding to CO2 Levels"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047411/19272" target="_top" id="2047411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As you can see, the answer seems comprehensive and details current and historic CO2 levels in parts per million (PPM). By contrast, Bing Chat took a different approach.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-bing-responding-to-co2-levels.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot Bing responding to CO2 Levels"                ></p><p> The first notable difference is the approach taken in quantifying CO2 levels. Rather than list CO2 levels in terms of ppm, Bing Chat presented the data in terms of percentages.</p><p> The length and tone of the responses also differed. The Bing Chat response was shorter and more restrained, not offering opinions on the problem or potential solutions.</p><p> Bard produced a longer answer that also discussed the problem and the need to take urgent action. This was outside the focus of the question, but it confirms just how quickly the tone and direction of any research can be swayed depending on the tool you use.</p><h2 id="Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Accuracy"><a href="#Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Response-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Accuracy"></a>Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Response Accuracy</h2><p> Before we look at this, it is important to note that both tools make clear that the accuracy of the information generated cannot be guaranteed. As such, we are not going to check every detail. Rather, we will look at how easy it is to fact-check the response of each tool.</p><p> Based on the answers to our original question, one major difference was apparent. Although the Bing Chat reply was less specific with the information, it did supply links to the cited sources. On the other hand, Google Bard provided no links in its response.</p><p> Furthermore, Bing Chat also allows you to scroll down to the “traditional” Bing search engine. Bard has included a <strong>Google it</strong> button, which activates a hyperlink that launches Google in a new tab. These are both useful features that allow you to check the supplied info against further sources.</p><p> This is probably good because one other interesting feature in Bard’s reply was the ability to view other drafts. Although the figures in the other drafts were similar, there was variation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-bard-co2-levels-with-other-drafts-showing.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot Bard CO2 Levels with other drafts showing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The main takeaway from this section is the importance of checking the accuracy of the information received from any chatbot.</p><h2 id="Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Bing-Chat-vs-Google-Bard-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Ease of Use"></a>Bing Chat vs. Google Bard: Ease of Use</h2><p> There is nothing complicated about either model. If you have used a messaging app, you can use these tools. However, we did notice some differences that are relevant here.</p><p> We liked the fact that Bing Chat allowed you to scroll down to the Bing search engine. The <strong>Google it</strong> button was similar but involved opening new tabs. It’s not a big issue, but the Bing option was just that bit easier to use.</p><p> Perhaps more telling was another issue we found when testing the tools. We found ourselves puzzled by Bard’s response to a simple request to “write some bullet points for a blog on global warming.” This should be a request that any chatbot should handle. But, as you can see, Bard seemed confused by the request.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bard-responding-to-requests-for-bullet-points.jpg"                      alt="Bard responding to requests for bullet points"                ></p><p> Whereas Bing Chat handled the request perfectly and responded with some bullet points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bing-chat-screenshot-global-warming-blog-points.jpg"                      alt="Bing Chat Screenshot Global Warming Blog Points"                ></p><p> We did manage to get a response from Bard by rewording the prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-bard-response-to-reworded-essay-prompt.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of bard response to reworded essay prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144278/7443" target="_top" id="2144278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144278/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As both platforms are going through rapid development, the user experience will continue to improve.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880944/19272" target="_top" id="1880944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Are-the-Differences-Between-the-Language-Models"><a href="#What-Are-the-Differences-Between-the-Language-Models" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Differences Between the Language Models?"></a>What Are the Differences Between the Language Models?</h2><p> The last major difference regards the “engines” that power both platforms. These Large Language Models (LLMs) are the underpinning technology. We don’t need to go into great detail, but LLMs are important when choosing a platform.</p><p> Bing Chat uses GPT-4 to generate results, whereas Google’s LaMDA powers Google Bard. As a result, the architecture of the models is different, and this can affect the answers.</p><p> GPT-4 is a generative model. It generates answers based on the text it’s been trained on. By contrast, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-google-lamda-ai/" >LaMDA works differently <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>—it is a discriminative model, meaning it can distinguish between various kinds of text.</p><p> In essence, this should mean that GPT-4 is better at generating creative content, while LaMDA is better at answering questions about facts.</p><h2 id="Which-Is-Best-for-You-Bing-Chat-or-Google-Bard"><a href="#Which-Is-Best-for-You-Bing-Chat-or-Google-Bard" class="headerlink" title="Which Is Best for You: Bing Chat or Google Bard?"></a>Which Is Best for You: Bing Chat or Google Bard?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/confused-880735_1920.jpg"                      alt="confused-880735_1920"                ></p><p> This is a case of choosing the right tool for the right job. When we compare the performance of both platforms, Bing Chat seems to edge it. However, there are some provisos to consider. The first is that the Microsoft offering is a more complete product, while Bard is still rough around the edges.</p><p> But don’t rule Bard out. We liked the more fact-driven approach that Google Bard took; the inclusion of ppm levels of CO2 was closer to the spirit of the original question than the Bing response. This is what we would expect to see, given its underlying architecture.</p><p> Another useful feature of Google Bard was its ability to return multi-draft options on a single prompt. This was lacking with Bing Chat.</p><p> Finally, the platforms that the tools run on are also a consideration. For example, Bing Chat is restricted to running on the Microsoft Edge Browser, while Google Bard will run on any supported browser.</p><p> Both tools are incredibly powerful and can generate intelligent answers to any prompt. But both have pros and cons, and the ultimate choice is likely to be decided by factors like user preferences and the desired output type.</p><p> They’re free to use, so we advise trying them both. These are impressive tools that are changing the way we use the internet.</p><h2 id="The-Era-of-the-Chatbot-Is-Upon-Us"><a href="#The-Era-of-the-Chatbot-Is-Upon-Us" class="headerlink" title="The Era of the Chatbot Is Upon Us"></a>The Era of the Chatbot Is Upon Us</h2><p> Regardless of the flaws we found and our quibbles with the chatbots, these are amazing technological feats that will play an ever-increasing part in our lives. The rapid development of technology will continue to push the boundaries of what these tools can achieve and how we use them.</p><p> As AI-powered chatbots like Google Bard and Bing Chat become more sophisticated and capable of handling complex tasks, they will become an even more integral part of our daily lives.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-mastering-youtube-list-mix-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] Mastering YouTube List Mix A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-detailed-insights-into-youtubes-monthly-income-model/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Detailed Insights Into YouTube's Monthly Income Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-securing-your-gaming-memories-without-game-bar/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Securing Your Gaming Memories Without Game Bar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/archiving-made-simple-saving-chatgpt-talks/"><u>Archiving Made Simple: Saving ChatGPT Talks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/comparing-creativity-in-3-bot-systems/"><u>Comparing Creativity in 3 Bot Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/earnings-elevated-the-synergy-of-video-content-viewership-and-metric-mastery/"><u>Earnings Elevated: The Synergy of Video Content, Viewership & Metric Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/expert-advice-on-lifting-your-chatgpt-ban/"><u>Expert Advice on Lifting Your ChatGPT Ban</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/how-generative-ai-fails-in-humanized-text-conversations/"><u>How Generative AI Fails in Humanized Text Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-special-features-virtual-location-on-poco-m6-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Use Special Features - Virtual Location On Poco M6 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, when I need to mobilize my day (which actually means to go write in another room in the house), I turn to my MacBook Pro. Or, if I’m editing videos, I stand before my iMac and have at it.</p><p>On both of those Apple machines, I had been using the built-in Safari browser for years. However, with each passing day, I became more and more frustrated with Safari and wound up having to turn to a different browser as my default.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/" >The best VPNs for iPhone and iPad (yes, you need to use one) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Let me explain.</p><h2 id="Safari-is-good-but…"><a href="#Safari-is-good-but…" class="headerlink" title="Safari is good but…"></a>Safari is good but…</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-deny-websites-access-to-your-location-in-safari-and-why-you-should/" >Safari is a good browser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It has features that I like (such as great tab management) and it’s one of the best options for Apple laptops because it’s optimized for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-make-your-macbook-battery-last-all-day/" >MacOS battery life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When I purchased my first MacBook Pro (I think it was 2016), any time I tried to use a different browser, I noticed the battery life dropped dramatically. Because of this, I refused to set a non-Apple browser as my default.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-new-in-macos-sonoma-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >What’s new in MacOS Sonoma? Here’s everything you need to know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Things are quite different now and most browsers don’t drain the battery nearly as badly as they once did. Of course, that battery drain wasn’t totally on the shoulders of those third-party browsers. That first MacBook Pro I purchased simply had unacceptable battery life. Now, it doesn’t matter which browser I use, as the battery life on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-pro-m2-max-review/" >my MacBook Pro (with Apple Silicon) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is outstanding. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Beyond what was once a dreadful battery drain, there are two issues with Safari that frustrate me to no end.</p><p>The first is how random the browser is when opening links from other apps. Sometimes the app will open the link in the current window I’m using. Other times, the clicked link will open a new window. And it doesn’t matter that I’ve set Safari to always open links from other apps in a new tab…the browser is just too stubborn.</p><p>Sure, Safari has a handy <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-merge-multiple-safari-windows-and-why-you-should/" >Merge Window feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which makes it possible to merge all open windows into one. But I shouldn’t have to do that. If Apple includes a feature to force all links to open in new tabs, it should be honored. Every browser I’ve ever used on Linux doesn’t suffer from this problem, so you’d think Apple could get it right as well.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-save-a-webpage-as-a-pdf-in-apple-safari/" >How to save a webpage as a PDF in Safari (without the ads) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But that’s not the biggest frustration I regularly experience with Apple Safari.</p><p>On a daily basis, I’ll be viewing a site and Safari will inevitably pop up the message that the site is using too much memory. When this happens, the site most often reloads (which means I lose my place). Although this seems random, it happens far too often to be acceptable. </p><p>To make matters worse, there’s nothing that can be done about this. You can’t increase the amount of memory Safari uses and you can’t block the warning. And because so many sites are very poorly designed and developed, this behavior is not going to stop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-I-use-instead"><a href="#What-I-use-instead" class="headerlink" title="What I use instead"></a>What I use instead</h2><p>Combine those two issues and you have the making for one very (and regularly) frustrated user.

First off, Opera has become my default browser on Linux (which I use throughout the day). So it makes perfect sense that it would be my default on MacOS. On top of this, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/opera-workspaces-is-tab-management-perfection/" >Opera’s tab management <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is even better than Safari’s, which is a big win in my eyes. It also doesn’t hurt that the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/opera-one-is-an-exciting-new-path-for-the-opera-browser-with-one-big-caveat/" >recent redesign of Opera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes it perform considerably better than Safari. It also has a better-looking UI and all the features I need.</p><p>Even better, it doesn’t force reload pages because it believes a site is using too much memory. That means whatever I’m reading or working on won’t get interrupted by that ridiculous popup.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/firefox-vs-opera-which-web-browser-is-best-for-you/" >Firefox vs Opera: Which web browser is best for you? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple should be able to do better with Safari. But until it does, I cannot continue working with a browser that doesn’t work with me.</p><p>If you’re a MacOS user, I recommend dropping Safari as your default browser and <a class="link"   href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera" >giving Opera a try <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It works brilliantly on MacOS and doesn’t have those frustrating quirks that inevitably interrupt whatever it is you’re doing to remind you that it’s not quite up to the job.</p><h4 id="Networking"><a href="#Networking" class="headerlink" title="Networking"></a>Networking</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-5g-laptop/"  title="The best 5G laptops: Samsung, Lenovo, and more lead with 5G connectivity">The best 5G laptops: Samsung, Lenovo, and more lead with 5G connectivity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-test-your-internet-speed-the-quick-and-easy-way/"  title="How to test your internet speed the quick and easy way">How to test your internet speed the quick and easy way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/"  title="The top 5 VPN services: How do these VPNs compare?">The top 5 VPN services: How do these VPNs compare?

Discover the Latest Free AI-Powered Programming Tools"></a>Revolutionize Your Applescripting! Discover the Latest Free AI-Powered Programming Tools</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/c0987300d436cf85470f55fc371de64bee01713a/2024/06/10/68ec2b2a-51b8-4706-a7ef-436dc251cec9/craig.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280"                      alt="craig"                ></p><p>Craig Federighi, Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering</p><p>Image: Apple</p><p>Apple today announced AI additions to its Xcode development environment, aiming to increase the productivity of programmers building apps across Apple’s product line. </p><p>For those of you who aren’t programmers, let’s take a moment to discuss just what a development environment does. To do this, a good analogy is a chef’s kitchen. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/live-updates-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024-including-ios-18-siri-ai-more/" >Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>A baker’s kitchen, for example, will be different from one focused on low-carb cooking. A baker’s kitchen may revolve around a stand mixer, and have an assortment of racks for cooling and preparation. There would be ample storage for flour, sugar, and other baking staples. </p><p>A kitchen focused on low-carb cooking would have equipment like spiralizers, chopping gadgets, sous-vide machines, and an air fryer or two. The storage focus would be the challenge of finding fridge and counter storage for fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as lean proteins.</p><p>Each of these work environments is tailored to the individual needs and working style of the person doing the work, customized with certain commonly used tools, and even optimized for reducing steps.</p><p>A programmer’s development environment, whether it be Xcode for Apple development, Visual Studio for Microsoft applications, or PhpStorm (my primary coding environment) for building web applications, is also an environment that can be tailored to its user’s needs. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-put-gpt-4o-through-my-coding-tests-and-it-aced-them-except-for-one-weird-result/" >I put GPT-4o through my coding tests and it aced them - except for one weird result <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Coders work on screen and define our “floor space” by the arrangement of windows and panes on that screen. We also have “major appliances,” except instead of a stove and refrigerator, we have an editor and a debugger. Many of us carefully arrange our windows and panes to save steps, and often save different layouts of tools depending on what stage of coding we’re involved in at the time. </p><p>Let’s belabor our kitchen analogy a bit more. How many of us, growing up, helped out mom and dad by preparing the food, perhaps chopping up the vegetables or cleaning up or doing the dishes? When we were helping out, we were not the “chef,” but instead very valued helpers (even if we did sneak a morsel here or there when a parent seemed like they weren’t watching).</p><p>In the case of a coding environment, the AI additions are like these kitchen helpers. AI is nowhere near ready to go out and build a major application. But it can undertake numerous small and often tedious tasks that are part of the coding process. In the past year, I’ve used AI numerous times to help out my coding and I’m convinced I saved a month or more delegating the creation and analysis of small subroutines to the AI. </p><p>Apple’s version of AI is called <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-how-the-iphones-on-device-and-cloud-based-ai-will-work/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. At the very end of the keynote, Craig Federighi announced a number of key Apple Intelligence-powered features for Xcode, Apple’s development environment. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-visionos-2-features-unveiled-at-wwdc-2024-what-im-excited-about-and-puzzled-by/" >New VisionOS 2 features unveiled at WWDC: What I’m excited about (and puzzled by) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>First, he discussed how Apple Intelligence has been built into developer SDKs. An SDK is a software developer kit, effectively a way for developers to incorporate pre-existing OS technology into their apps.</p><p>Continuing our kitchen analogy, think of SDKs as roughly analogous to meal kits. Federighi talked about incorporating <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-unveils-on-device-ai-image-generator-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/" >Image Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Apple’s text-to-image AI feature) into developer apps with just a few lines of code. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>That’s kind of like how a cook might make a meal by opening up the meal kit and just incorporating all the ingredients to come up with a delicious dinner. In the case of the meal kit, the kit developers did all the work in figuring out the ingredients, selecting and providing them, and creating the recipes and instructions. In the case of an SDK, the SDK developer did all the work in figuring out the technology (like text to image), and providing that to the app developers. </p><p>Any apps that use the standard editable text view for creating text gain full access to Apple Intelligence writing tools (summaries, etic). </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-linkedins-ai-course-made-me-a-better-python-developer/" >How LinkedIn’s free AI course made me a better Python developer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Siri has also been upgraded with Apple Intelligence. Developers who use SiriKit (the SDK for Siri) will gain Siri-based enhancements for features like lists, notes, media, messaging, payments, restaurant reservations, VolP calling, and workouts. </p><p>Likewise, Apple is adding to its App Intents functionality. These are predefined actions or tasks that apps can perform, allowing them to integrate seamlessly with Siri and other system features to enhance user interactions and automation. Federighi stated that Apple is enhancing intents with Apple Intelligence capabilities in the following categories: Books, browsers, Cameras, document readers, file management, Journals, Mail, Photos, presentations, spreadsheets, whiteboards, and word processors. </p><p>These allow developers to easily add new AI functionality without much additional work, and certainly without the full investment in AI that was necessary to create the features to begin with.</p><p>In terms of the coding process itself, Apple announced that it’s adding generative intelligence to Xcode. Specifically, it will provide on-device code completion (writing small chunks of code for a developer) for the Swift language. It’s interesting that he used the term “code completion” instead of writing code, because code completion implies a much more controlled process simply extending and clarifying code production. Full code writing would involve telling the AI to write a module with a given spec, and from this announcement, it’s not clear Xcode will do that. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code/" >How to use ChatGPT to write code: What it can and can’t do for you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Xcode will be available to answer questions for Swift developers. This can save a ton of time. Developers can ask how to code specific SDK calls (for example, “how can I add image playground here?”). Presumably (again, not specified in the keynote) developers could also ask the AI “what does this code do” and get a more detailed explanation. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" >Generative AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in development environments is a fairly new thing, and environment producers as well as individual developers are still learning where generative AI can be a helpful new power tool or where it becomes something that just gets in the way.</p><p>We came a long way in the last year, and my bet is that by WWDC 2025, this feature set will seem rudimentary because we’ve all learned a lot more about how AI can help coding. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Use-GPT-3-in-OpenAI-Playground"><a href="#How-to-Use-GPT-3-in-OpenAI-Playground" class="headerlink" title="How to Use GPT-3 in OpenAI Playground"></a>How to Use GPT-3 in OpenAI Playground</h2><p> You don’t need to be a software developer to try GPT-3, the famous language model that can fool most people into thinking it’s a human author. Get access by creating an account and heading to the OpenAI Playground to try it out for free.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> On the surface, the website looks geared toward programmers, but we’ll show you that it’s just as accessible to someone with no coding knowledge. If you’re waiting for the next GPT model to be released, why not spend some time experimenting in OpenAI’s Playground?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-OpenAI-Playground"><a href="#What-Is-OpenAI-Playground" class="headerlink" title="What Is OpenAI Playground?"></a>What Is OpenAI Playground?</h2><p> In November 2021, the waitlist was removed for GPT-3, allowing more people to use the OpenAI API. But what most people don’t know is that a version of GPT-3 is accessible through the OpenAI Playground.</p><p> OpenAI Playground allows users to explore and experiment with OpenAI’s artificial intelligence models, including GPT-3 (the precursor to GPT-3.5 that first powered ChatGPT and GPT-4, the updated version). From this site, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/" >visit DALL-E to create AI images from text descriptions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or experiment with all the different <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> So, how do ChatGPT and OpenAI Playground differ?</p><p> ChatGPT is the front-facing implementation of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, allowing users to interact with the language model and generate responses. Whereas OpenAI Playground is more akin to a development tool and comes with more options and flexibility that allow for the testing of specific models (perhaps before being integrated into a project or for research projects).</p><p> Now, want to give it a try? Here’s how you use GPT-3 in OpenAI Playground.</p><h2 id="1-Create-an-Account"><a href="#1-Create-an-Account" class="headerlink" title="1. Create an Account"></a>1.

You must input your email and a valid mobile number and answer a quick question about why you want to use OpenAI.</li><li>Once that’s done, click <strong>Playground</strong> from the navigation menu at the top of the screen. It will bring you to the <strong>Chat</strong> mode page, with some adjustable settings in the sidebar.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/open-ai-playground-interface-gpt3.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of OpenAI&#39;s Playground interface"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972684/19272" target="_top" id="1972684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Enter-a-Prompt"><a href="#2-Enter-a-Prompt" class="headerlink" title="2. Enter a Prompt"></a>2. Enter a Prompt</h2><p> To use GPT-3, you will need to enter what’s called a prompt. A prompt could be a question, an instruction, or even an incomplete sentence, to which the model will generate a completion.</p><p> First, click on the drop-down menu under <strong>Mode</strong> and select <strong>Complete</strong>. Type your prompt into the large, empty text box, then click <strong>Submit.</strong> Wait a few moments for the system to process your request; before long, it will generate an answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/open-ai-playground-complete-mode.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Complete mode interface in OpenAI Playground"                ></p><p> You can also experiment with the <strong>Edit</strong> mode, which you can use to submit a text and check for grammatical errors.</p><p> To get the most out of GPT-3, you will need to think of a good prompt. Good prompts are specific and give context to help GPT-3 generate an appropriate answer. As a demonstration, we asked GPT-3 to “list a few names for a small dog.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/openai-playground-prompt-dog-names.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of OpenAI Playground prompt completion."                ></p><p> The response listed different names for small dog <strong>breeds</strong> like Poodle, Chihuahua, and Yorkshire Terrier. However, we were hoping to get some suggestions for pet names. So let’s try again, this time using the keywords “pet names” and “small fluffy dog.”</p><p> This time, the results turned out closer to what we imagined with a list of names like Biscuit, Fido, and Gizmo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/openai-playground-prompt-dog-pet-names.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of OpenAI Playground prompt completion listing dog pet names."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Experiment-With-Different-Ideas-and-Prompts"><a href="#3-Experiment-With-Different-Ideas-and-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="3.

In the top right corner of the page, click on <strong>Personal</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage account</strong>, then click <strong>Usage</strong> from the navigation bar on the left.</p><p> Tokens are used to calculate the fees, and they are based on how many words, or groups of characters, you use in a prompt; this also includes the text result you get from GPT-3. You can see how many tokens you use each time in the bottom right of the text box area.</p><p> Tokens are then translated to dollars, of which you have $5 to spend in the first three months (previously $18). It’s a strange pricing model to wrap your head around at first, but what matters is that it’s more than enough to play with. When we tested it out over a couple of days, we only used $0.11 from our total.</p><h2 id="5-Switch-to-a-Different-GPT-Model"><a href="#5-Switch-to-a-Different-GPT-Model" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can select <strong>Model</strong> in the settings bar on the right of the text box to switch between them.</p><p> By default, it’s set to the Davinci model, but selecting other models has the benefit of costing less and working faster to complete prompts. In general, sticking to Davinci will give you the best results when understanding context and producing complex and creative answers.</p><p> If you want to try the other models out for a lower cost, here is a summary of what they are good for:</p><ul><li><strong>Curie:</strong> Costs less than Davinci and can process requests faster. It’s particularly useful for tasks such as translation, answering direct questions, extracting important information, or summarizing technical information into bullet points.</li><li><strong>Babbage:</strong> Costs less, is very fast, and is great at creating text if you give it repeated examples and information. It can find straightforward patterns in text, and in terms of creative tasks, it’s good for completing sentences, generating basic story plots, or helping you to brainstorm ideas.</li><li><strong>Ada:</strong> The fastest model in the family with the lowest costs; use this model if you don’t require precise answers. It’s especially recommended for creative applications rather than generating detailed and exact information.</li></ul><p> Remember that you’ll still incur costs for each model you choose, but the cost per token will vary.</p><h2 id="6-Improve-Your-Results"><a href="#6-Improve-Your-Results" class="headerlink" title="6. Improve Your Results"></a>6. Improve Your Results</h2><p> The <strong>Temperature</strong> setting is a key parameter to play with if you want to fine-tune your results. When the temperature is set to <strong>zero</strong> you will get the same answer from GPT-3, even if you resubmit the exact same prompt. Raising this number will result in more varied and unpredictable answers.</p><p> One way to remember what it does is to use an analogy. We can say that setting the temperature to zero gives you a cool, calm, and collected result. On the other hand, increasing the temperature to 1 will give you hot results that are varied and unpredictable.</p><p> To demonstrate this parameter, we asked GPT-3 to briefly summarize how to create an exciting new podcast. With the temperature set to zero, the answer was the same no matter how many times we hit the <strong>Regenerate</strong> button. By contrast, when we changed the temperature to <strong>1,</strong> we got plenty of varied results that offered slightly different steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gpt-3-settings-tempearture.jpg"                      alt="Three screenshots of GPT-3 generated text offering different answers for the same prompt."                ></p><p> This is a great parameter to play around with if you want to use GPT-3 to generate ideas, such as brainstorming video ideas for YouTube or generating new social media posts. Understanding this one setting can help you to fine-tune the results you get from GPT-3.</p><p> There are lots of ways that an AI language model can help you in day-to-day tasks.

Within several months of GPT-3 being open to the public and the launch of GPT-3.5 through ChatGPT, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-launches-gpt-4-artificial-intelligence-model/" >OpenAI announced GPT-4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, bringing new functions to the artificial intelligence model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/openai-playground-gpt-4-model-option.jpg"                      alt="openai playground gpt-4 model option"                ></p><p> Among <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-new-gpt4-features-explained/" >GPT-4’s best new features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the ability to submit images to the model, which it can understand, discuss, and respond to through text. It’s an incredible new advancement that makes the system multi-modal.</p><p> Currently, only users with access to OpenAI’s GPT-4 API can use the GPT-4 model in OpenAI Playground if they’ve spent $0.50 or more for accounts created after August 18, 2023, or $1 or more for accounts created prior to this. Alternatively, if you have a paid subscription, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt4/" >use GPT-4 on ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> It’s becoming standard practice for companies like OpenAI to control the release of new models by using research previews and limited wait lists. It’s also prioritizing access to developers who have strong ideas for how they might implement the technology in an app, for example.</p><p> This is one reason why it’s still worth playing around in GPT-3. There are many people who are curious about generative AI and want to try it out for fun. So, while you wait for the latest model to become available, GPT-3 is your playground.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="OpenAI-Playground-Open-to-Everyone"><a href="#OpenAI-Playground-Open-to-Everyone" class="headerlink" title="OpenAI Playground: Open to Everyone"></a>OpenAI Playground: Open to Everyone</h2><p> You don’t need special knowledge of machine learning systems to play around with GPT-3.

Rather, Apple is now moving further into AI language models. </p><p>Last Thursday, Apple released <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/apple/DCLM-7B" >DCLM-Baseline-7B <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a 7 billion parameter language model, on Hugging Face. The model is part of the DataComp for Language Models (DCLM) benchmark, an initiative to improve the quality of training datasets for language models.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-try-gpt-4o-mini-3-ways-to-access-the-smarter-cheaper-ai-model-and-2-are-free/" >Want to try GPT-4o mini? 3 ways to access the smarter, cheaper AI model - and 2 are free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>At 7 billion parameters, this model is comparable to popular models such as Llama 2, Gemma, and more. When tested on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark against popular models around the same size, DCLM-Baseline-7B performed competitively, even outperforming Mistral 7B, as seen below. </p><p>Apple&#x2F;Hugging Face</p><p>Despite its impressive performance, one of the DCLM-Baseline-7B’s biggest standouts is that the model is truly open-sourced, with “open data, open weight models, open training code,” as highlighted by Vaishaal Shankar, a research scientist at Apple. </p><blockquote><p>We have released our DCLM models on huggingface! To our knowledge these are by far the best performing truly open-source models (open data, open weight models, open training code) 1&#x2F;5</p><p>— Vaishaal Shankar (@Vaishaal) <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Vaishaal/status/1813956553042711006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" >July 18, 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p></blockquote><p>Many are commending Apple for this approach as it allows other researchers and developers to build on the models and further grow advancements in the space. The model was trained on the <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0" >DCLM-BASELINE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> data, combined with <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata" >StarCoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="http://proofpile2/" >ProofPile2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>data, to reach proficiency in other tasks such as coding and math.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/" >Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In addition to releasing DCLM-Baseline-7B, model weights, training code, and dataset, Apple also included a powerful 1.4 billion parameter version in the package. </p><p>This isn’t Apple’s first go-around with AI models, having released others such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-model-can-understand-your-home-screen-and-supercharge-siri/" >Ferret-UI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a multimodal large language model (MLLM), and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >Reference Resolution As Language Modeling (ReALM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a conversational AI system.

However, we’re not completely out of the paper trail just yet. There are still incidentals – like your work ID or certain travel passes – that you may not be able to present virtually, and places that may not accept <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-wallet-now-supports-40-more-banks-can-you-finally-pay-by-phone/" >Google Pay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple Pay, and more.

With enough space to hold five cards (the most on this list), it indeed resembles a classic wallet and not just a cardholder. The Ezmo wallet also doubles as a phone stand, so you can watch your favorite entertainment on the go or keep your phone screen visible at your desk. The stand has adjustable viewing angles in both portrait and landscape modes.</p><p>It’s made of vegan leather and comes in four traditional color options (black, dark brown, navy blue, and dove gray). The Ezmo MagSafe wallet also features a protective lining with RFID technology to safeguard your cards’ information while preventing them from becoming demagnetized.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-magsafe-wallet-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-apple-or-anker-and-its-on-sale/"><strong>The best MagSafe wallet I’ve tested is not made by Apple or Anker</strong></a></p><p>I tested the Ezmo wallet for several weeks in my everyday activities, including my commute from New Jersey to New York City. When evaluating MagSafe wallets, I always look for easy and seamless access to my NJ Transit card, which I need to grab and put away quickly. Thanks to the notch on the front of the Ezmo wallet, I can store my transit card in the front. It’s easy to slide out, so I highly recommend choosing one with a front-notch option if you’re looking for a commuter-friendly wallet. </p><p>I also like how the Ezmo MagSafe wallet provides enough space for five cards and even folded cash. It’s perfect for holding my debit card, work badge, and other incidentals like paper train tickets. I don’t often keep my driver’s license or credit card in my phone wallet while going to work, but I like that I can do so if I need or want to for another event or activity. </p><p>The phone stand was nice, too. I enjoyed being able to prop my phone up while at the office. I even found myself using the back half of the wallet as a makeshift grip on the train, which added some extra stability. Although it’s one of the priciest options on this list, I think it’s well worth the investment due to its multi-functionality and excellent quality, especially if you use your MagSafe wallet daily. The Ezmo wallet is also available in a tracking version – the LOC8 MagSafe Finder Wallet and Stand – if you’re prone to losing things frequently. </p><p>Current users on the Journey website said they liked the slim profile, smart design, larger card capacity, and sleek material – so much so that the wallet has a 5&#x2F;5-star rating online, with one customer noting that it “does it all really well.”</p><p><strong>Journey Ezmo wallet and phone stand features:</strong> Multi-functional | RFID protection | Built-in lock to prevent card slippage | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 66 mm x 102.5 mm x 12.5 mm | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Up to 5 cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6566078&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6566078.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSXMTP6W/ref=asc_df_B0BSXMTP6W1727175600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BSXMTP6W&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C0e97ca03-ab11-4bcf-aadd-d99e9fc7acc5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Still easily fits in a pocket</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Comes unattached upon harsh impact</li><li>Can only hold 2 cards comfortably</li></ul><h2 id="Clckr-MagSafe-phone-holder-and-wallet"><a href="#Clckr-MagSafe-phone-holder-and-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet"></a>Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-durability"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-durability" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for durability"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for durability</h3><p>The Clckr is the ultimate multitasker wallet and is perfect for the person who loves to run out the door with nothing else in hand. Not only is the Clckr slim and stylish in design and comes in lavender or black, but it securely stores up to two cards. </p><p>When former ZDNET associate editor Christina Darby tested the Clckr, she noted that the cardholder slot kept her cards secure but easy to access when needed. Darby said she wished it could fit just one more card, but she reported that other features compensated for this. </p><p>Coupled with this wallet’s practicality is its top-tier multi-functionality. “Without adding any extra bulk, the cardholder has a foldable strip down the middle that, when clicked into place, acts as a kickstand or phone grip. Thanks to the powerful 3500 G magnet, the grip makes it easy to transport my phone, while the kickstand makes for the perfect portable tripod,” Darby wrote. </p><p>When you want to remove the Clckr, simply lightly twist and pull, and you’ll feel the magnet tug off. This makes wireless charging a breeze, though you must remember to put the Clckr back on before leaving the house. </p><p>Current Amazon users said they liked the design, card storage, and security the Clckr provided. Still, some customers said they experienced breaking early and thought the magnet was weak. </p><p><strong>Clckr MagSafe wallet features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.38 x 2.44 x 3.94 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Holds two cards comfortably</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Magnetic-Magsafe-Wallet-Through/dp/B0CJVRFTSH?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C0e97ca03-ab11-4bcf-aadd-d99e9fc7acc5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>ID window</li><li>Slim design</li><li>Portrait or landscape stand</li><li>Affordable luxury</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No cash or alternative storage space</li><li>Limited color options</li></ul><h2 id="Satechi-Magnetic-Wallet-Stand"><a href="#Satechi-Magnetic-Wallet-Stand" class="headerlink" title="Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand"></a>Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-Wallet-with-an-ID-slot"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-Wallet-with-an-ID-slot" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot"></a>Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot</h3><p>The Satechi Magnetic Wallet stand combines an affordable yet premium luxury build and design with everyday functionality. With four card slots and a designated space for your ID, there’s a spot for your essential cards to keep you on the go. </p><p>ZDNET reviewer Adrian Kingsley-Hughes calls Satechi’s model the perfect balance of style and functionality. “The main thing I like about this wallet is the build quality,” Kingsley-Hughes wrote in his review. “The materials look and feel premium, and the construction is such that it will not fall apart without a real fight.” </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-dozens-of-magsafe-wallets-on-my-iphone-and-this-is-one-you-should-buy/"><strong>I’ve tested dozens of MagSafe wallets on my iPhone, and this is one you should buy</strong></a></p><p>The Satechi wallet can also double as a phone stand, oriented horizontally or vertically. It is made of scratch-resistant vegan leather that is easy to wipe clean. Equipped with strong magnets, the Satechi wallet is MagSafe, and you can be assured it won’t fall off the back of your device. </p><p>Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet’s sturdiness, robust hinge mechanism, and quality. However, some users said the magnet needed to be stronger. </p><p>If you’re looking for a clean, premium phone wallet, the Satechi delivers with a rugged yet elegant design and build. </p><p><strong>Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.1 x 2.6 x 0.4 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> 4 cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1391923&u=4338022&m=90301&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://my-balance-meals.pxf.io/1r0rrg" >View now at Moft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-MagSafe-Wallet-Compatible-Viewing/dp/B09XBBR76H?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C0e97ca03-ab11-4bcf-aadd-d99e9fc7acc5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Slim</li><li>Strong magnetic grip</li><li>Stackable with other Moft products</li><li>Doubles as a stand</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>A little snug with 3 cards</li><li>Can be a little tricky to get cards in and out in certain situations</li></ul><h2 id="Moft-Snap-on-Phone-Stand-and-Wallet"><a href="#Moft-Snap-on-Phone-Stand-and-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet"></a>Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-minimalist-MagSafe-wallet"><a href="#Best-minimalist-MagSafe-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Best minimalist MagSafe wallet"></a>Best minimalist MagSafe wallet</h3><p>This MagSafe wallet and stand combo combines minimalist luxury with functionality. Inspired by origami, the Moft wallet can hold up to three cards and quickly flips into a stand. It’s ultra-thin, practically unseen, and unfelt while attached to your device. </p><p>The Moft wallet also features uber-strong magnets designed to stack with the brand’s other products, like its <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/" >MagSafe battery pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This ensures you can keep all your favorite cards at your fingertips and still charge your phone without removing the wallet. </p><p>When I tested this wallet during my commute, I was impressed with its overall aesthetic and look – it’s super sophisticated and sleek. However, I found it challenging to remove cards, especially when using public transit, and three cards (my ID, NJ Transit card, and debit card) felt a little too snug for my liking. But for someone on the go more often (or someone who needs less card capacity), this is a winner. It comes in seven punchy colors, truly elevates your phone’s look, and ensures that you are never without a way to prop up your device. The Moft stand is a favorite at ZDNET, and editor Sabrina Ortiz regularly uses one on her phone. </p><p>I’d be remiss not to mention that while this isn’t a preferred pick for commuting, I do reach for it often while at home or doing casual errands or activities. It’s also been a great option for the pool and beach now that summer is here because of its less bulky construction, and it’s such a multifunctional add-on for anyone that my mother usurped my original test unit (I’ve been told it’s a great stand for reading recipes off your phone while cooking or baking). </p><p>Customers on the Moft website said they liked the strong magnets, premium look and feel, and card capacity of the Snap-on wallet. Some customers said the fabric within the folds did not hold up well, while others remained impressed with the wallet’s overall function. </p><p><strong>Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.8 x 2.5 x 0.24 inches <strong>Card capacity:</strong> three cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/c/159047/228232/3937?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.casetify.com/product/clear-magsafe-wallet/pocket/magsafe-wallet-case?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Casetify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Numerous color and design options</li><li>Card port for easy access</li><li>Made with recycled materials</li><li>RFID technology</li><li>Lightweight</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not multi-functional</li><li>Pricier for what you get</li><li>No front notch</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Casetify-Snappy-Leather-MagSafe-Wallet"><a href="#Casetify-Snappy-Leather-MagSafe-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Casetify Snappy Leather MagSafe Wallet"></a>Casetify Snappy Leather MagSafe Wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-fun-color-or-customization"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-fun-color-or-customization" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization</h3><p>Casetify offers a basic yet sleek MagSafe wallet for storing your cards with easy access. The wallet features built-in RFID technology to protect your card information, a card port on the back, and is made from 50% recycled materials. </p><p>It’s compatible with MagSafe phones and cases and has several colors and Casetify-exclusive designs. You can even customize your wallet with words, initials, or phrases. When I tested this MagSafe wallet last month, I liked the various design options and the overall simplicity. You can store up to three cards, but it wasn’t convenient for storing folded cash. I used it to hold my NJ Transit card and debit card, and I would have to check to ensure I didn’t lose any bills every time I took a card out. </p><p>The simple design is great for card storage at a festival, bar, or other event, but it didn’t work as well for my commute. Although there’s a card port on the back that helps nudge cards out, it was a bit annoying and inconvenient. I’d have to remove the wallet to access my transit card when it became tricky to take out. I much prefer having a notch on the front of the wallet when using it for commuting purposes. </p><p>Current Casetify users said they liked the wallet’s texture and overall design, along with the different designs and color options. Similarly to my experience, one customer said the wallet was perfect for specific use cases. “For certain occasions, this mag wallet has been perfect. The wallet is constructed very well and has a slot big enough for your credit card and ID,” the customer wrote. </p><p><strong>Casetify MagSafe wallet features:</strong> Protects from magnetic damage | Card port for easy access | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> two cards </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/ESR-HaloLock-MagSafe-Vegan-Leather-Wallet-Stand-Compatible-iPhone-14-14-Plus-14-Pro-14-Pro-Max-13-12-Series-Not-mini-3-Card-Holder-Brown/1597120317?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-Leather-Adjustable-Compatible/dp/B09K75L2L1?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C0e97ca03-ab11-4bcf-aadd-d99e9fc7acc5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Stores up to three cards</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Has more of a traditional wallet look and feel</li><li>Budget friendly</li><li>ID card slot</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Magnet could be stronger</li><li>Bulkier</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123732" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123732/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ESR-HaloLock-wallet"><a href="#ESR-HaloLock-wallet" class="headerlink" title="ESR HaloLock wallet"></a>ESR HaloLock wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-a-traditional-wallet-feel"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-a-traditional-wallet-feel" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel</h3><p>If you’re looking to stick to an old-school look and don’t need as much card storage as the Journey Ezmo wallet, the ESR HaloLock is a traditional flip-and-fold wallet that takes on what’s becoming a modern classic.

The HaloLock also doubles as a kickstand, adjusting to any angle from 15 to 160 degrees. </p><p>ZDNET’s Matthew Miller tested the ESR wallet in 2022 and liked its slim and stylish design. “I have had great success using it with a Peak Design Everyday Case, so it is possible to use it with a MagSafe case. The vegan leather material is supple and feels good in the hand. The stitching appears to be solid, and the stand has held up extremely well,” Miller said. </p><p>Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet’s appearance, strength, performance, and size.

So, while many options on this list are excellent choices for your ID, debit card, and work badge, you will only do you good if your payment of choice is a good old Benjamin. </p><p>Rather than featuring a pocket design, the Pelican swings open on hinges – like a door – to reveal two grip-secured compartments: one is optimal for cards and the other for cash. A snap-on closure secures both compartments and closes the “door.”</p><p>When ZDNET’s Christina Darby tested the Pelican wallet, she struggled to obtain her goods. “The only downside to the clasp is that it’s almost too secure; I feel I have to pry it open to get my cards out. I’ve even broken a nail in the process.” Darby wrote. However, she said the extra security gave her peace of mind, especially in large crowds. </p><p>Darby also noted that the Pelican’s magnet is one of the strongest on any MagSafe accessory she tested, adding even more security. The main downside of the Pelican is its bulkiness compared to the other options on this list.

We also considered the following when making our top selections, and recommend keeping these in mind when making your own final decision. </p><ul><li><strong>Practicality:</strong> These wallets aim to maximize efficiency. They all hold at least two of your most essential cards for easy access without adding too much weight or bulk to your phone, while potentially offering even more. Consider the amount of card storage you want to help narrow your search. If you’re looking for storage for less than two, try checking out the best cardholders.</li><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> When making my final selections, I considered MagSafe wallets that may not fit every card you have but can add extra functionality or use for what they lack in card space. I also thought about how well they functioned during my day-to-day activities, which included my commute from NJ to NYC. Remember how versatile (or not) you want your wallet to be. Do you care if it doubles as a stand? A battery pack? Or do you just need card storage?</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Your wallet is essential in your daily life, and the same rule applies when considering wallet wallets affixed to your phone. No matter which product you select, you want it to last, especially if you’re paying more than a few bucks. After extensive ZDNET testing and research, we intentionally chose wallets that will last you more than a few weeks. Be sure to consider if you’re looking to make a long-term investment for a wallet accessory or need something quick for an event, vacation, festival, or other.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> As always, setting a budget to help you narrow your search parameters is a good idea. If you’re looking to invest in a MagSafe wallet accessory long term, spending $45 or more would probably be worth it. If you’re only looking to use a MagSafe wallet for a few days or one event, it’s probably not worth your money to spend more than $40.</li><li><strong>Occasion</strong>: Like your phone case, any accessory you affix to your phone becomes an extension of your personality. Consider the type of design or color you’d like (especially if your wallet will become a mainstay of your cell), and consider how you’ll be using a phone wallet. Is it for everyday use? Special occasions? Events here and there? Narrowing down how you want to use your wallet can help you ultimately set a budget and decide on necessary features.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-MagSafe-wallets"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-MagSafe-wallets" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?"></a>How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?</h2><p>ZDNET went hands-on with all the MagSafe wallets on this list. We spend time using these wallets on our own iPhones during daily lives to test out card storage, magnetic strength, comfort, usability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product’s add-in value. That is, can you “add-in” this product to your life and benefit from its presence? Or, is it another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-phones-are-MagSafe-compatible"><a href="#Which-phones-are-MagSafe-compatible" class="headerlink" title="Which phones are MagSafe compatible?"></a>Which phones are MagSafe compatible?</h2><p>The iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Pro are all MagSafe compatible.

This technology uses radio waves to identify people or objects. </p><p>There are devices that can read information contained in a wireless device or “tag” from a distance without making any physical contact or requiring a line of sight – for example, the chips in credit or debit cards.

Analyzing 10 Possible Scenarios"></a>Can You Get Fired for Using ChatGPT? Analyzing 10 Possible Scenarios</h2><p> The legal implications of using ChatGPT, among other AI tools, in the workplace remain a moot point. Some businesses agree that AI can accelerate their daily operations. Alternatively, companies like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Samsung, Amazon, and Apple prohibit their workforce from even using ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Whether or not using AI can lead to termination varies case by case. To help you understand the guidelines, let’s discuss how employers generally see these use cases of ChatGPT.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Publishing-ChatGPT-Generated-Articles"><a href="#1-Publishing-ChatGPT-Generated-Articles" class="headerlink" title="1. Publishing ChatGPT-Generated Articles"></a>1. Publishing ChatGPT-Generated Articles</h2><p> Considering the accessibility and sophistication of language models, you might consider publishing AI content. Offloading writing tasks to ChatGPT will boost your output. It only needs seconds to generate a coherent, error-free blog on any given topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-writing-and-article-about-ai.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Writing the Intro and Body of an Article About Ai"                ></p><p> Although convenient, we advise against submitting AI content. ChatGPT merely scrapes and rephrases information from datasets—its output likely contains plagiarized text. Your employer can fire you for plagiarism if you carelessly use them in your articles.</p><p> Explore <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-use-ai-as-writer-editor/" >responsible ways of writing with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.

Some employees rely on it for drafting performance reports. They make ChatGPT write customized reviews by submitting their subordinates’ key performance indicators (KPIs).</p><p> However, using ChatGPT this way is deceitful—it doesn’t have enough context to assess your employees accurately. You’ll definitely get fired for submitting erroneous ratings. Workers might even file lawsuits against you depending on the gravity of the situation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037355/7443" target="_top" id="2037355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037355/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Asking-ChatGPT-to-Draft-Legal-Documents-and-Contracts"><a href="#3-Asking-ChatGPT-to-Draft-Legal-Documents-and-Contracts" class="headerlink" title="3.

The company uses non-API content for data training. While <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/does-chatgpt-learn-from-user-conversations/" >ChatGPT doesn’t learn from chats in real-time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, its trainers still screen and filter input. You should never divulge company information.</p><p> Considering these privacy guidelines, uploading legal paperwork onto ChatGPT violates the non-disclosure agreement between you and your employer. You’ll likely get fired and sued if you get caught.</p><p> Moreover, ChatGPT can only customize its output to an extent. Carelessly trusting the generic contracts it drafts might cause legal complications down the road. Run all your paperwork through the appropriate professionals.</p><h2 id="4-Using-ChatGPT-to-Generate-Reports-and-Insights"><a href="#4-Using-ChatGPT-to-Generate-Reports-and-Insights" class="headerlink" title="4. Using ChatGPT to Generate Reports and Insights"></a>4. Using ChatGPT to Generate Reports and Insights</h2><p> Only use ChatGPT for research when analyzing reports. AI can help test formulas and answer general knowledge questions, but you should never feed it company insights. Again, OpenAI records all conversations. Your employer might sue you and terminate your employment contract for breaching the NDA.</p><p> And make sure you double-check the figures that ChatGPT presents. Blindly trusting AI’s formulas will cause errors in your computations, which might get you into trouble. Employers could also fire you if you consistently submit erroneous data.</p><h2 id="5-Making-ChatGPT-Reply-to-Messages"><a href="#5-Making-ChatGPT-Reply-to-Messages" class="headerlink" title="5.

To save time, you might consider automating some responses. ChatGPT can compose customized output based on the messages and instructions you input.</p><p> Although you won’t get fired, you should still avoid sending ChatGPT-generated responses. They come across as rude and distant. You’ll elicit more favorable responses if you compose unique, personalized messages.</p><h2 id="6-Composing-Emails-on-ChatGPT"><a href="#6-Composing-Emails-on-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="6. Composing Emails on ChatGPT"></a>6. Composing Emails on ChatGPT</h2><p> Employees find it harder to write emails than chat messages because of their formal nature.

It just makes them look unprofessional. Use AI to generate writing prompts and create outlines, but you should still compose messages yourself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Doing-Research-and-Analyses-on-ChatGPT"><a href="#7-Doing-Research-and-Analyses-on-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="7.

It can help you explore any topic under the sun.</p><p> You won’t get fired if you research responsibly. As with any other online resource, it’s best to verify information multiple times before presenting it. Compare data from other sources. Solely relying on ChatGPT’s output puts you at risk of spreading misinformation, a potentially career-ending mistake.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993645">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993645">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993645%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993645/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Using-Code-Snippets-Written-by-ChatGPT"><a href="#8-Using-Code-Snippets-Written-by-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="8.

Many programmers reduce their workload by offloading much of the coding process to ChatGPT.</p><p> While convenient, it’s also justifiable grounds for termination. ChatGPT merely pulls lines of codes from existing datasets—the snippets it produces likely comprise copyright-protected structures.

While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms.

With enough space to hold five cards (the most on this list), it indeed resembles a classic wallet and not just a cardholder. The Ezmo wallet also doubles as a phone stand, so you can watch your favorite entertainment on the go or keep your phone screen visible at your desk. The stand has adjustable viewing angles in both portrait and landscape modes.</p><p>It’s made of vegan leather and comes in four traditional color options (black, dark brown, navy blue, and dove gray). The Ezmo MagSafe wallet also features a protective lining with RFID technology to safeguard your cards’ information while preventing them from becoming demagnetized.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-magsafe-wallet-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-apple-or-anker-and-its-on-sale/"><strong>The best MagSafe wallet I’ve tested is not made by Apple or Anker</strong></a></p><p>I tested the Ezmo wallet for several weeks in my everyday activities, including my commute from New Jersey to New York City. When evaluating MagSafe wallets, I always look for easy and seamless access to my NJ Transit card, which I need to grab and put away quickly. Thanks to the notch on the front of the Ezmo wallet, I can store my transit card in the front. It’s easy to slide out, so I highly recommend choosing one with a front-notch option if you’re looking for a commuter-friendly wallet. </p><p>I also like how the Ezmo MagSafe wallet provides enough space for five cards and even folded cash. It’s perfect for holding my debit card, work badge, and other incidentals like paper train tickets. I don’t often keep my driver’s license or credit card in my phone wallet while going to work, but I like that I can do so if I need or want to for another event or activity. </p><p>The phone stand was nice, too. I enjoyed being able to prop my phone up while at the office. I even found myself using the back half of the wallet as a makeshift grip on the train, which added some extra stability. Although it’s one of the priciest options on this list, I think it’s well worth the investment due to its multi-functionality and excellent quality, especially if you use your MagSafe wallet daily. The Ezmo wallet is also available in a tracking version – the LOC8 MagSafe Finder Wallet and Stand – if you’re prone to losing things frequently. </p><p>Current users on the Journey website said they liked the slim profile, smart design, larger card capacity, and sleek material – so much so that the wallet has a 5&#x2F;5-star rating online, with one customer noting that it “does it all really well.”</p><p><strong>Journey Ezmo wallet and phone stand features:</strong> Multi-functional | RFID protection | Built-in lock to prevent card slippage | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 66 mm x 102.5 mm x 12.5 mm | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Up to 5 cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6566078&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6566078.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSXMTP6W/ref=asc_df_B0BSXMTP6W1726743600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BSXMTP6W&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce8393eb4-0a70-431f-84dc-683c890e4b0f%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Still easily fits in a pocket</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Comes unattached upon harsh impact</li><li>Can only hold 2 cards comfortably</li></ul><h2 id="Clckr-MagSafe-phone-holder-and-wallet"><a href="#Clckr-MagSafe-phone-holder-and-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet"></a>Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-durability"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-durability" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for durability"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for durability</h3><p>The Clckr is the ultimate multitasker wallet and is perfect for the person who loves to run out the door with nothing else in hand. Not only is the Clckr slim and stylish in design and comes in lavender or black, but it securely stores up to two cards. </p><p>When former ZDNET associate editor Christina Darby tested the Clckr, she noted that the cardholder slot kept her cards secure but easy to access when needed. Darby said she wished it could fit just one more card, but she reported that other features compensated for this. </p><p>Coupled with this wallet’s practicality is its top-tier multi-functionality. “Without adding any extra bulk, the cardholder has a foldable strip down the middle that, when clicked into place, acts as a kickstand or phone grip. Thanks to the powerful 3500 G magnet, the grip makes it easy to transport my phone, while the kickstand makes for the perfect portable tripod,” Darby wrote. </p><p>When you want to remove the Clckr, simply lightly twist and pull, and you’ll feel the magnet tug off. This makes wireless charging a breeze, though you must remember to put the Clckr back on before leaving the house. </p><p>Current Amazon users said they liked the design, card storage, and security the Clckr provided. Still, some customers said they experienced breaking early and thought the magnet was weak. </p><p><strong>Clckr MagSafe wallet features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.38 x 2.44 x 3.94 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Holds two cards comfortably</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Magnetic-Magsafe-Wallet-Through/dp/B0CJVRFTSH?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce8393eb4-0a70-431f-84dc-683c890e4b0f%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>ID window</li><li>Slim design</li><li>Portrait or landscape stand</li><li>Affordable luxury</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No cash or alternative storage space</li><li>Limited color options</li></ul><h2 id="Satechi-Magnetic-Wallet-Stand"><a href="#Satechi-Magnetic-Wallet-Stand" class="headerlink" title="Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand"></a>Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-Wallet-with-an-ID-slot"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-Wallet-with-an-ID-slot" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot"></a>Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot</h3><p>The Satechi Magnetic Wallet stand combines an affordable yet premium luxury build and design with everyday functionality. With four card slots and a designated space for your ID, there’s a spot for your essential cards to keep you on the go. </p><p>ZDNET reviewer Adrian Kingsley-Hughes calls Satechi’s model the perfect balance of style and functionality. “The main thing I like about this wallet is the build quality,” Kingsley-Hughes wrote in his review. “The materials look and feel premium, and the construction is such that it will not fall apart without a real fight.” </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-dozens-of-magsafe-wallets-on-my-iphone-and-this-is-one-you-should-buy/"><strong>I’ve tested dozens of MagSafe wallets on my iPhone, and this is one you should buy</strong></a></p><p>The Satechi wallet can also double as a phone stand, oriented horizontally or vertically. It is made of scratch-resistant vegan leather that is easy to wipe clean. Equipped with strong magnets, the Satechi wallet is MagSafe, and you can be assured it won’t fall off the back of your device. </p><p>Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet’s sturdiness, robust hinge mechanism, and quality. However, some users said the magnet needed to be stronger. </p><p>If you’re looking for a clean, premium phone wallet, the Satechi delivers with a rugged yet elegant design and build. </p><p><strong>Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.1 x 2.6 x 0.4 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> 4 cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XBBR76H?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce8393eb4-0a70-431f-84dc-683c890e4b0f%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Slim</li><li>Strong magnetic grip</li><li>Stackable with other Moft products</li><li>Doubles as a stand</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>A little snug with 3 cards</li><li>Can be a little tricky to get cards in and out in certain situations</li></ul><h2 id="Moft-Snap-on-Phone-Stand-and-Wallet"><a href="#Moft-Snap-on-Phone-Stand-and-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet"></a>Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-minimalist-MagSafe-wallet"><a href="#Best-minimalist-MagSafe-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Best minimalist MagSafe wallet"></a>Best minimalist MagSafe wallet</h3><p>This MagSafe wallet and stand combo combines minimalist luxury with functionality. Inspired by origami, the Moft wallet can hold up to three cards and quickly flips into a stand. It’s ultra-thin, practically unseen, and unfelt while attached to your device. </p><p>The Moft wallet also features uber-strong magnets designed to stack with the brand’s other products, like its <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/" >MagSafe battery pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This ensures you can keep all your favorite cards at your fingertips and still charge your phone without removing the wallet. </p><p>When I tested this wallet during my commute, I was impressed with its overall aesthetic and look – it’s super sophisticated and sleek. However, I found it challenging to remove cards, especially when using public transit, and three cards (my ID, NJ Transit card, and debit card) felt a little too snug for my liking. But for someone on the go more often (or someone who needs less card capacity), this is a winner. It comes in seven punchy colors, truly elevates your phone’s look, and ensures that you are never without a way to prop up your device. The Moft stand is a favorite at ZDNET, and editor Sabrina Ortiz regularly uses one on her phone. </p><p>I’d be remiss not to mention that while this isn’t a preferred pick for commuting, I do reach for it often while at home or doing casual errands or activities. It’s also been a great option for the pool and beach now that summer is here because of its less bulky construction, and it’s such a multifunctional add-on for anyone that my mother usurped my original test unit (I’ve been told it’s a great stand for reading recipes off your phone while cooking or baking). </p><p>Customers on the Moft website said they liked the strong magnets, premium look and feel, and card capacity of the Snap-on wallet. Some customers said the fabric within the folds did not hold up well, while others remained impressed with the wallet’s overall function. </p><p><strong>Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet features:</strong> Multi-functional | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.8 x 2.5 x 0.24 inches <strong>Card capacity:</strong> three cards</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/c/159047/228232/3937?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.casetify.com/product/clear-magsafe-wallet/pocket/magsafe-wallet-case?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Casetify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Numerous color and design options</li><li>Card port for easy access</li><li>Made with recycled materials</li><li>RFID technology</li><li>Lightweight</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Not multi-functional</li><li>Pricier for what you get</li><li>No front notch</li></ul><h2 id="Casetify-Snappy-Leather-MagSafe-Wallet"><a href="#Casetify-Snappy-Leather-MagSafe-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Casetify Snappy Leather MagSafe Wallet"></a>Casetify Snappy Leather MagSafe Wallet</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-fun-color-or-customization"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-fun-color-or-customization" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization</h3><p>Casetify offers a basic yet sleek MagSafe wallet for storing your cards with easy access. The wallet features built-in RFID technology to protect your card information, a card port on the back, and is made from 50% recycled materials. </p><p>It’s compatible with MagSafe phones and cases and has several colors and Casetify-exclusive designs. You can even customize your wallet with words, initials, or phrases. When I tested this MagSafe wallet last month, I liked the various design options and the overall simplicity. You can store up to three cards, but it wasn’t convenient for storing folded cash. I used it to hold my NJ Transit card and debit card, and I would have to check to ensure I didn’t lose any bills every time I took a card out. </p><p>The simple design is great for card storage at a festival, bar, or other event, but it didn’t work as well for my commute. Although there’s a card port on the back that helps nudge cards out, it was a bit annoying and inconvenient. I’d have to remove the wallet to access my transit card when it became tricky to take out. I much prefer having a notch on the front of the wallet when using it for commuting purposes. </p><p>Current Casetify users said they liked the wallet’s texture and overall design, along with the different designs and color options. Similarly to my experience, one customer said the wallet was perfect for specific use cases. “For certain occasions, this mag wallet has been perfect. The wallet is constructed very well and has a slot big enough for your credit card and ID,” the customer wrote. </p><p><strong>Casetify MagSafe wallet features:</strong> Protects from magnetic damage | Card port for easy access | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> two cards </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/ESR-HaloLock-MagSafe-Vegan-Leather-Wallet-Stand-Compatible-iPhone-14-14-Plus-14-Pro-14-Pro-Max-13-12-Series-Not-mini-3-Card-Holder-Brown/1597120317?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/ESR-HaloLock-Leather-Adjustable-Compatible/dp/B09K75L2L1?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ce8393eb4-0a70-431f-84dc-683c890e4b0f%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Stores up to three cards</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Has more of a traditional wallet look and feel</li><li>Budget friendly</li><li>ID card slot</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Magnet could be stronger</li><li>Bulkier</li></ul><h2 id="ESR-HaloLock-wallet"><a href="#ESR-HaloLock-wallet" class="headerlink" title="ESR HaloLock wallet"></a>ESR HaloLock wallet</h2><h3 id="Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-a-traditional-wallet-feel"><a href="#Best-MagSafe-wallet-for-a-traditional-wallet-feel" class="headerlink" title="Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel"></a>Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel</h3><p>If you’re looking to stick to an old-school look and don’t need as much card storage as the Journey Ezmo wallet, the ESR HaloLock is a traditional flip-and-fold wallet that takes on what’s becoming a modern classic. It’s made with vegan leather and metallic mesh lining, and it indeed looks like you stuck a high-end, luxury wallet to the back of your phone. On the front fold, there’s a slot for one card, giving easy access to your most important card. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esr-halolock-wallet-stand-hands-on/"><strong>ESR HaloLock Wallet Stand hands-on</strong></a></p><p>When the wallet is flipped open, two more slots have a clear window that is optimal for your ID. The HaloLock also doubles as a kickstand, adjusting to any angle from 15 to 160 degrees. </p><p>ZDNET’s Matthew Miller tested the ESR wallet in 2022 and liked its slim and stylish design. “I have had great success using it with a Peak Design Everyday Case, so it is possible to use it with a MagSafe case. The vegan leather material is supple and feels good in the hand. The stitching appears to be solid, and the stand has held up extremely well,” Miller said. </p><p>Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet’s appearance, strength, performance, and size.

So, while many options on this list are excellent choices for your ID, debit card, and work badge, you will only do you good if your payment of choice is a good old Benjamin. </p><p>Rather than featuring a pocket design, the Pelican swings open on hinges – like a door – to reveal two grip-secured compartments: one is optimal for cards and the other for cash. A snap-on closure secures both compartments and closes the “door.”</p><p>When ZDNET’s Christina Darby tested the Pelican wallet, she struggled to obtain her goods. “The only downside to the clasp is that it’s almost too secure; I feel I have to pry it open to get my cards out. I’ve even broken a nail in the process.” Darby wrote. However, she said the extra security gave her peace of mind, especially in large crowds. </p><p>Darby also noted that the Pelican’s magnet is one of the strongest on any MagSafe accessory she tested, adding even more security. The main downside of the Pelican is its bulkiness compared to the other options on this list. However, according to Darby, it still fits comfortably in a back pocket. </p><p>Current Amazon users said they liked the wallet’s sleek and minimal appearance, but some customers said they have mixed opinions on its durability. </p><p><strong>Pelican magnetic wallet and card holder features:</strong> <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.97 x 2.79 x 0.47 inches | <strong>Card capacity:</strong> Holds up to 4 cards plus cash</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-MagSafe-wallet"><a href="#What-is-the-best-MagSafe-wallet" class="headerlink" title="What is the best MagSafe wallet?"></a>What is the best MagSafe wallet?</h2><p>If you’re looking for a MagSafe wallet that does it all, the Journey Ezmo wallet is a sure pick, and is ZDNET’s best overall thanks to its durability, versatility, and function.

We also considered the following when making our top selections, and recommend keeping these in mind when making your own final decision. </p><ul><li><strong>Practicality:</strong> These wallets aim to maximize efficiency. They all hold at least two of your most essential cards for easy access without adding too much weight or bulk to your phone, while potentially offering even more. Consider the amount of card storage you want to help narrow your search. If you’re looking for storage for less than two, try checking out the best cardholders.</li><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> When making my final selections, I considered MagSafe wallets that may not fit every card you have but can add extra functionality or use for what they lack in card space. I also thought about how well they functioned during my day-to-day activities, which included my commute from NJ to NYC. Remember how versatile (or not) you want your wallet to be. Do you care if it doubles as a stand? A battery pack? Or do you just need card storage?</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Your wallet is essential in your daily life, and the same rule applies when considering wallet wallets affixed to your phone. No matter which product you select, you want it to last, especially if you’re paying more than a few bucks. After extensive ZDNET testing and research, we intentionally chose wallets that will last you more than a few weeks. Be sure to consider if you’re looking to make a long-term investment for a wallet accessory or need something quick for an event, vacation, festival, or other.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> As always, setting a budget to help you narrow your search parameters is a good idea. If you’re looking to invest in a MagSafe wallet accessory long term, spending $45 or more would probably be worth it. If you’re only looking to use a MagSafe wallet for a few days or one event, it’s probably not worth your money to spend more than $40.</li><li><strong>Occasion</strong>: Like your phone case, any accessory you affix to your phone becomes an extension of your personality. Consider the type of design or color you’d like (especially if your wallet will become a mainstay of your cell), and consider how you’ll be using a phone wallet. Is it for everyday use? Special occasions? Events here and there? Narrowing down how you want to use your wallet can help you ultimately set a budget and decide on necessary features.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-MagSafe-wallets"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-MagSafe-wallets" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?"></a>How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?</h2><p>ZDNET went hands-on with all the MagSafe wallets on this list.

That is, can you “add-in” this product to your life and benefit from its presence? Or, is it another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. </p><h2 id="Which-phones-are-MagSafe-compatible"><a href="#Which-phones-are-MagSafe-compatible" class="headerlink" title="Which phones are MagSafe compatible?"></a>Which phones are MagSafe compatible?</h2><p>The iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Pro are all MagSafe compatible.

Depending on which model you use, ChatGPT’s knowledge base has a cut-off date of September 2021 (for GPT-3.5) or January 2022 (for GPT-4). This means ChatGPT can’t accurately handle requests related to events that occurred after that time.</p><p> Now, OpenAI is solving this problem by updating ChatGPT to use the internet to provide up-to-date responses to your queries. Here’s what you need to know about this (re)addition to ChatGPT.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Can-Now-Use-Bing-to-Access-the-Internet"><a href="#ChatGPT-Can-Now-Use-Bing-to-Access-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Can Now Use Bing to Access the Internet"></a>ChatGPT Can Now Use Bing to Access the Internet</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/default-chatgpt-gpt-4-model-version.jpg"                      alt="Default ChatGPT GPT-4 model version"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002018/7443" target="_top" id="2002018">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002018" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002018/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> One of the major selling points of AI chatbots like Bard and Bing AI is that they can access the internet to retrieve up-to-date information. ChatGPT, on the other hand, couldn’t do that. That changed briefly after OpenAI rolled out browsing capabilities in May 2022, but the feature was subsequently taken offline because of abuse. One such abuse saw ChatGPT users use the browsing feature to bypass paywalls on websites to access news articles for free.</p><p> After that, ChatGPT reverted to its original design without internet access. The chatbot instead depended on third-party plugins to pull information from the web. Now, <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes" >OpenAI has announced <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it is rolling out “Browse with Bing,” a feature that uses the Bing Search Engine API to provide ChatGPT the much-needed ability to access up-to-date information. To avoid some of the mistakes that plagued the previous roll-out of the feature, OpenAI has placed significant restrictions on sites that ChatGPT’s browsing feature can access. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gptbot-and-why-are-websites-blocking-it/" >Websites that have placed restrictions on ChatGPT’s GPTBot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are exempted from being featured in ChatGPT’s synthesized responses.</p><p> But how can you enable the feature in ChatGPT? How will the return of internet access impact ChatGPT users? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="How-to-Enable-Browsing-on-ChatGPT"><a href="#How-to-Enable-Browsing-on-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable Browsing on ChatGPT"></a>How to Enable Browsing on ChatGPT</h2><p> To use the browsing feature, you must have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-should-upgrade-chatgpt-plus/" >paid ChatGPT Plus subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You can optionally tell the chatbot to start browsing a particular topic or question whenever you want recent information on a topic.</p><h2 id="What-ChatGPT-Internet-Access-Means-for-ChatGPT-Users"><a href="#What-ChatGPT-Internet-Access-Means-for-ChatGPT-Users" class="headerlink" title="What ChatGPT Internet Access Means for ChatGPT Users"></a>What ChatGPT Internet Access Means for ChatGPT Users</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-displaying-up-to-date-information.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT displaying up-to-date information"                ></p><p> The first impact of the return of internet access to ChatGPT is improved answers. ChatGPT will be able to provide more comprehensive and accurate replies. Right now, neither the GPT-3.5 nor GPT-4 models know anything about events or topics that happened after January 2022. This lack of knowledge makes ChatGPT unable to answer some questions or make assumptions that result in wrong replies.</p><p> When we tried conversations involving rapidly changing statistics or figures, the importance of internet access was crystal clear. While ChatGPT without browsing gave answers with wrong figures, ChatGPT with browsing returned more accurate statistics on topics like world population and smartphone sales statistics.</p><p> In the conversation below, we asked the default ChatGPT GPT-4 model which country has the highest population. It got it wrong.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-without-browsing.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT without browsing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094428/7443" target="_top" id="2094428">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094428" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094428/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> We then asked ChatGPT’s GPT-4 model with browsing turned on, and it got it right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-with-browsing.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT with browsing"                ></p><p> But it’s not all rosy. Internet access will also come with some drawbacks. It increases the risk of spreading misinformation if ChatGPT relies on websites with inaccurate, biased, or false information. The data sources used to train ChatGPT are sanitized to a considerable degree. This reduces the risk of the chatbot spreading misinformation and propaganda. However, with the unfettered access, we should probably expect more conversations about ChatGPT amplifying fake news and other types of misinformation in the future.</p><p> Another less obvious drawback of ChatGPT’s latest addition is its effect on news and information sources. Most websites depend on traffic to their website to generate revenue.

Some websites will block ChatGPT access and explain that “the website’s ‘robots.txt’ file prevents me from fetching the requested pages,” but many website owners will make no such provision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/chatgpt-refusing-to-access-websites-due-to-robots-script.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt refusing to access websites due to robots script"                ></p><p> Of course, search engines like Google and Bing will also potentially lose revenue from the ads on their search results pages.

Depending on which model you use, ChatGPT’s knowledge base has a cut-off date of September 2021 (for GPT-3.5) or January 2022 (for GPT-4). This means ChatGPT can’t accurately handle requests related to events that occurred after that time.</p><p> Now, OpenAI is solving this problem by updating ChatGPT to use the internet to provide up-to-date responses to your queries. Here’s what you need to know about this (re)addition to ChatGPT.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027167/19272" target="_top" id="2027167">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027167" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027167/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Can-Now-Use-Bing-to-Access-the-Internet-3"><a href="#ChatGPT-Can-Now-Use-Bing-to-Access-the-Internet-3" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Can Now Use Bing to Access the Internet"></a>ChatGPT Can Now Use Bing to Access the Internet</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/default-chatgpt-gpt-4-model-version.jpg"                      alt="Default ChatGPT GPT-4 model version"                ></p><p> One of the major selling points of AI chatbots like Bard and Bing AI is that they can access the internet to retrieve up-to-date information. ChatGPT, on the other hand, couldn’t do that. That changed briefly after OpenAI rolled out browsing capabilities in May 2022, but the feature was subsequently taken offline because of abuse. One such abuse saw ChatGPT users use the browsing feature to bypass paywalls on websites to access news articles for free.</p><p> After that, ChatGPT reverted to its original design without internet access. The chatbot instead depended on third-party plugins to pull information from the web. Now, <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes" >OpenAI has announced <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it is rolling out “Browse with Bing,” a feature that uses the Bing Search Engine API to provide ChatGPT the much-needed ability to access up-to-date information. To avoid some of the mistakes that plagued the previous roll-out of the feature, OpenAI has placed significant restrictions on sites that ChatGPT’s browsing feature can access. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gptbot-and-why-are-websites-blocking-it/" >Websites that have placed restrictions on ChatGPT’s GPTBot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are exempted from being featured in ChatGPT’s synthesized responses.</p><p> But how can you enable the feature in ChatGPT? How will the return of internet access impact ChatGPT users?

You can optionally tell the chatbot to start browsing a particular topic or question whenever you want recent information on a topic.</p><h2 id="What-ChatGPT-Internet-Access-Means-for-ChatGPT-Users-3"><a href="#What-ChatGPT-Internet-Access-Means-for-ChatGPT-Users-3" class="headerlink" title="What ChatGPT Internet Access Means for ChatGPT Users"></a>What ChatGPT Internet Access Means for ChatGPT Users</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-displaying-up-to-date-information.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT displaying up-to-date information"                ></p><p> The first impact of the return of internet access to ChatGPT is improved answers. ChatGPT will be able to provide more comprehensive and accurate replies. Right now, neither the GPT-3.5 nor GPT-4 models know anything about events or topics that happened after January 2022. This lack of knowledge makes ChatGPT unable to answer some questions or make assumptions that result in wrong replies.</p><p> When we tried conversations involving rapidly changing statistics or figures, the importance of internet access was crystal clear. While ChatGPT without browsing gave answers with wrong figures, ChatGPT with browsing returned more accurate statistics on topics like world population and smartphone sales statistics.</p><p> In the conversation below, we asked the default ChatGPT GPT-4 model which country has the highest population. It got it wrong.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-without-browsing.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT without browsing"                ></p><p> We then asked ChatGPT’s GPT-4 model with browsing turned on, and it got it right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-with-browsing.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT with browsing"                ></p><p> But it’s not all rosy. Internet access will also come with some drawbacks. It increases the risk of spreading misinformation if ChatGPT relies on websites with inaccurate, biased, or false information. The data sources used to train ChatGPT are sanitized to a considerable degree. This reduces the risk of the chatbot spreading misinformation and propaganda. However, with the unfettered access, we should probably expect more conversations about ChatGPT amplifying fake news and other types of misinformation in the future.</p><p> Another less obvious drawback of ChatGPT’s latest addition is its effect on news and information sources. Most websites depend on traffic to their website to generate revenue. ChatGPT with internet access somewhat undermines this by giving access to information from other websites without users having to visit them. This means ChatGPT will potentially deprive websites of ad revenues they would otherwise earn from users visiting their websites. Some websites will block ChatGPT access and explain that “the website’s ‘robots.txt’ file prevents me from fetching the requested pages,” but many website owners will make no such provision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/chatgpt-refusing-to-access-websites-due-to-robots-script.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt refusing to access websites due to robots script"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Of course, search engines like Google and Bing will also potentially lose revenue from the ads on their search results pages.

It features an adjustable stand with 8 configurations, a bumper and rugged shell for added drop protection, a stylus pocket, wireless charging capabilities, and more. Plus, Zugu has cases available for preorder for the new M4 iPad Pro models. </p><p>I tested this Zugu case on my iPad Air (pictured above) for the past few weeks along with several other cases, it’s my favorite. It’s extremely functional but still practical, providing true security from bumps and drops (not just operating as a light cover). I loved using it as a stand, especially while testing several note-taking apps this month. The material feels premium and expensive with a clean, appealing design. </p><p>And while the functionality is top-notch, my favorite thing about the Zugu case is the color. I’ve been using the case in the Desert Rose color, and as a true Gen-Z corporate girl, I love it. Many companies don’t cater to colors outside of black, white, tan, and brown, so the unique color choices are awesome, but I still wish there were more fun prints and designs. The new iPad Pro model cases also have limited colors for now, but I expect to see more soon.</p><p>Current customers on the Zugu website said they like the overall protection, functionality, quality, and aesthetic of the Zugu case. Many said the case is a great value and has a premium feel, and one customer even said they wished they’d found Zugu sooner. </p><p>What’s even better is that Zugu will pay a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zugucase.com/pages/free-ipad-repairs" >one-time AppleCare+ repair fee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if your iPad is damaged while in a Zugu case. The Zugu case is well worth the money in my opinion, and it’s a solid all-around case for style and protection.</p><p><strong>Zugu iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Adjustable stand with 8 angles | Bumper and rugged shell for drop protection | Air flow vents | Secure magnetic mount capability | Microfiber interior | Auto sleep&#x2F;wake magnetic cover | Stylus pocket on back | Wireless Apple Pencil charging compatibility | Free AppleCare+ Repair Fee</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fmath-exam-ipad-pro-12-9-6th-5th-gen-case%253Fvariant%253D47811892412744%2526type%253DFolio&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Fun designs and patterns</li><li>Folio style</li><li>Apple Pencil storage&#x2F;charging</li><li>Doubles as stand</li><li>Under $100</li><li>Shock absorption</li><li>Raised bezel design</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Stand configurations could be more comfortable</li><li>Folio front feels a bit flimsy</li><li>No cases for new 13-inch iPad Pro</li></ul><h2 id="Burga-iPad-Pro-Case"><a href="#Burga-iPad-Pro-Case" class="headerlink" title="Burga iPad Pro Case"></a>Burga iPad Pro Case</h2><h3 id="Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style"><a href="#Best-basic-iPad-Pro-case-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best basic iPad Pro case for style"></a>Best basic iPad Pro case for style</h3><p>Burga’s folio case for the iPad Pro combines style and function. It features a spot for stylus storage and Apple Pencil charging, has a hard shell backing and a soft close folio front, can be used as stand for your iPad, features shock absorption and a raised bezel design, and is overall sleek in profile. </p><p>When I tested the Burga case on the iPad Air the last few weeks (pictured above) I liked its light weight, handy Apple Pencil storage, folio style cover, stand configuration, and numerous prints and designs. It’s a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but I recommend bumping up to something more secure such as an Otterbox or even the Zugu case if you’re accident prone or are more rough around the edges when it comes to your tech. </p><p>I also wish the stand options on the case were a bit more comfortable for viewing, though it’s a nice add to have the option to prop up my iPad up at all while watching a show or video. For the $60 price tag though, I think this a great buy for the features you are getting, especially considering a similar folio case from Apple is now around $80 and ones at Casetify start at $92. </p><p>Current customers on the Burga website said they like the overall value of the case, with emphasis on the case’s design, build, and and quality. Many said they enjoyed the fun patterns and color options – which outdo most other case mentioned on this list in the color department, and compete with the likes of only Casetify. </p><p><strong>Burga iPad Pro Case features:</strong> Raised bezel design for camera and screen protection | Apple Pencil storage and charging spot | Variety of colors and styles | Shock absorbing bumper | Stand configurations | Never-fading prints </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/159047/499820/8585?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-pro.html?sp=1&searchclick=logi&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Logitech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Combo-Touch-iPad-12-9-inch/dp/B0938C32PZ?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C8f7cee92-d1c5-420a-8368-a113ee6a95c5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Combo-Touch-iPad-11-inch/dp/B0937Z63SR?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C8f7cee92-d1c5-420a-8368-a113ee6a95c5%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Detachable keyboard</li><li>Trackpad</li><li>Stylus storage</li><li>Backlit keys</li><li>More affordable than Apple’s Magic Keyboard</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Slightly heavy</li><li>Still pricey</li><li>Limited color options</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Logitech-Combo-Touch-Keyboard-Case"><a href="#Logitech-Combo-Touch-Keyboard-Case" class="headerlink" title="Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case"></a>Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case</h2><h3 id="Best-iPad-Pro-keyboard-case"><a href="#Best-iPad-Pro-keyboard-case" class="headerlink" title="Best iPad Pro keyboard case"></a>Best iPad Pro keyboard case</h3><p>The Logitech Combo Touch is our pick for the best overall iPad Pro keyboard case thanks to its top features and affordable price.

[They] are not perfect, but they deliver a more feature-rich experience than Apple’s first-party accessories at a fraction of the cost.

Moft makes some of the most innovate, origami-inspired mobile and tech accessories I’ve seen. </p><p>The Moft Snap Float Folio case features a strong magnetic connection with a sleek and slim design that makes the case feel elevated and premium. The stylus holder is a plus, and the case configures into three different angled positions. One standing position is an ultra high alignment (as pictured) which lifts your iPad up above much of the competitors. </p><p>The case is a duo system, so you can customize which parts you want to use at any given time. There’s a soft outside folio and a hard case set for extra protection. They can be used individually or together, and it’s easy to change. I tested the Moft case for the last month on my iPad Air, and I especially liked the standing configuration, which allowed it to be eye-level. It’s perfect for working from home or personal video calls. I also enjoyed the premium look and feel, which is certainly more elevated than some other case options on this list. One downside right now is there is no iPad Pro 13-inch case available.</p><p>Current Moft Float Folio users said they like the overall design and quality feel of the case, as well as the functionality thanks to the unique stand configurations. One customer even said Moft cases deserved more hype than they get. “It’s the best case and holder ever. The quality of materials is great, the finishes are great. You can put it in any position you’re thinking of and your iPad is very well protected too. Simply the best.

Check the size of the case to ensure that it will fit your iPad model, so it won’t be too small or too large.</li><li><strong>Build:</strong> iPad cases and covers can be made out of many different materials. The best iPad Pro cases and covers incorporate durable materials like rubber and polycarbonate plastic. Some are even rated for drop protection, providing an extra level of durability and security for your device.</li><li><strong>Features</strong>: Not all cases are created equal, and they don’t all offer the same features. Consider if you will want or need a trackpad or keyboard, stylus holder, adjustable stand, or other features to help narrow down your search and make it easier to find your top contenders. You don’t want to purchase a case that doesn’t fit your wants and needs.</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Why not add a little style to your iPad Pro? Many of the best iPad Pro cases and covers are available in a variety of different colors and patterns so you can add a splash of personality to your everyday carry, if that’s what you’re looking for.</li><li><strong>Budget:</strong> There are many affordable iPad Pro cases available, but there are also some that cost well over $100, depending on the design and features. Setting a budget for yourself can will help narrow your search parameters.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-iPad-Pro-cases"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-iPad-Pro-cases" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these iPad Pro cases?"></a>How did we choose these iPad Pro cases?</h2><p>We chose these iPad Pro case options after extensive research into the product category and by going hands-on with some of these products.
