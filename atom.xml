Students are already cheating with it, with many professors discovering essays and assignments written by the AI chatbot. Security professionals are voicing their concerns that scammers and threat actors are using it to write phishing emails and create malware.</p><p> So, with all these concerns, is OpenAI losing control of one of the most potent AI chatbots currently online? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="Understanding-How-ChatGPT-Works"><a href="#Understanding-How-ChatGPT-Works" class="headerlink" title="Understanding How ChatGPT Works"></a>Understanding How ChatGPT Works</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/artificial-intelligence.jpg"                      alt="a robot with a brain representing artificial intelligence"                ></p><p> Before we can get a clear picture of how much OpenAI is losing control of ChatGPT, we must first understand <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> In a nutshell, ChatGPT is trained using a massive collection of data sourced from different corners of the internet. ChatGPT’s training data includes encyclopedias, scientific papers, internet forums, news websites, and knowledge repositories like Wikipedia. Basically, it feeds on the massive amount of data available on the World Wide Web.</p><p> As it scours the internet, it collates scientific knowledge, health tips, religious text, and all the good kinds of data you can think of. But it also sifts through a ton of negative information: curse words, NSFW and adult content, information on how to make malware, and a bulk of the bad stuff you can find on the internet.</p><p> There’s no foolproof way to ensure that ChatGPT learns only from positive information while discarding the bad ones. Technically, it’s impractical to do so at a large scale, especially for an AI like ChatGPT that needs to train on so much data. Furthermore, some information can be used for both good and evil purposes, and ChatGPT would have no way of knowing its intent unless it’s put into a greater context.</p><p> So, from the onset, you have an AI capable of “good and evil.” It’s then the responsibility of OpenAI to ensure that ChatGPT’s “evil” side is not exploited for unethical gains. The question is; is OpenAI doing enough to keep ChatGPT as ethical as possible? Or has OpenAI lost control of ChatGPT?</p><h2 id="Is-ChatGPT-Too-Powerful-for-Its-Own-Good"><a href="#Is-ChatGPT-Too-Powerful-for-Its-Own-Good" class="headerlink" title="Is ChatGPT Too Powerful for Its Own Good?"></a>Is ChatGPT Too Powerful for Its Own Good?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/plastic-robot-with-blue-face.jpg"                      alt="plastic robot with blue face"                ></p><p> In the early days of ChatGPT, you could get the chatbot to create guides on making bombs if you asked nicely. Instructions on making malware or writing a perfect scam email were also in the picture.</p><p> However, once OpenAI realized these ethical problems, the company scrambled to enact rules to stop the chatbot from generating responses that promote illegal, controversial, or unethical actions. For instance, the latest ChatGPT version will refuse to answer any direct prompt about bomb-making or how to cheat in an examination.</p><p> Unfortunately, OpenAI can only provide a band-aid solution to the problem. Rather than building rigid controls on the GPT-3 layer to stop ChatGPT from being negatively exploited, OpenAI seems to be focused on training the chatbot to appear ethical. This approach doesn’t take away ChatGPT’s ability to answer questions about, say, cheating in examinations—it simply teaches the chatbot to “refuse to answer.”</p><p> So, if anyone phrases their prompts differently by adopting ChatGPT jailbreaking tricks, bypassing these band-aid restrictions is embarrassingly easy. In case you’re not familiar with the concept, ChatGPT jailbreaks are carefully worded prompts to get ChatGPT to ignore its own rules.</p><p> Take a look at some examples below. If you ask ChatGPT how to cheat in exams, it will not produce any helpful response.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-cheat-in-an-exams.jpg"                      alt="How to cheat in an exams by ChatGPT"                ></p><p> But if you jailbreak ChatGPT using specially-crafted prompts, it will give you tips on cheating on an exam using concealed notes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/how-to-smuggle-a-hidden-notes.jpg"                      alt="How to smuggle a hidden notes"                ></p><p> Here’s another example: we asked the vanilla ChatGPT an unethical question, and OpenAI’s safeguards stopped it from answering.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

However, for every safeguard it employs, ChatGPT tends to become a bit less valuable. It’s a dilemma.</p><p> For instance, safeguards against describing violent actions might diminish ChatGPT’s ability to write a novel involving a crime scene. As OpenAI ramps up safety measures, it inevitably sacrifices chunks of its abilities in the process. This is why ChatGPT has suffered a significant decline in functionality since OpenAI’s renewed push for stricter moderation.</p><p> But how much more of ChatGPT’s abilities will OpenAI be willing to sacrifice to make the chatbot safer? This all ties neatly into a long-held belief within the AI community—large language models like ChatGPT are notoriously hard to control, even by their own creators.</p><h2 id="Can-OpenAI-Put-ChatGPT-Under-Control"><a href="#Can-OpenAI-Put-ChatGPT-Under-Control" class="headerlink" title="Can OpenAI Put ChatGPT Under Control?"></a>Can OpenAI Put ChatGPT Under Control?</h2><p> For now, OpenAI doesn’t seem to have a clear-cut solution to avoid the unethical use of its tool. Ensuring that ChatGPT is used ethically is a game of cat and mouse. While OpenAI uncovers ways people are employing to game the system, its users are also constantly tinkering and probing the system to discover creative new ways to make ChatGPT do what it isn’t supposed to do.</p><p> So, will OpenAI find a reliable long-term solution to this problem? Only time will tell.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

The nifty AI chat is used widely for creative, work-related, and entertainment purposes. But what happens when your ChatGPT account gets blocked?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> While not a common occurrence, it can be frustrating and inconvenient when it happens. To ensure you’re not left in the dark, here are potential reasons OpenAI might block your ChatGPT account and how to unblock it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Too-Many-Login-Attempts"><a href="#1-Too-Many-Login-Attempts" class="headerlink" title="1. Too Many Login Attempts"></a>1. Too Many Login Attempts</h2><p> One of the most common reasons your ChatGPT account might be blocked is you have tried logging in too many times with the wrong password or username. This could happen if you forget your login credentials or someone else tries to access your account without your permission.</p><p> If you get the “Your account has been blocked after multiple consecutive login attempts” message, then chances are this is the reason. The good news is this block is usually only temporary. To fix this issue, you can wait for a certain period, typically a few hours, before attempting to log in again. You can also try resetting your password.</p><h2 id="2-Using-a-VPN"><a href="#2-Using-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="2. Using a VPN"></a>2. Using a VPN</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vpn-tool.jpg"                      alt="VPN on smartphone"                ></p><p> Another reason your ChatGPT account might be blocked is if you are using a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-vpn-how-tunneling-works/" >VPN (virtual private network) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> service to access the internet. While VPNs offer privacy and security benefits, they can also be used for malicious activities or to circumvent usage restrictions.</p><p> As a precautionary measure, OpenAI may temporarily block accounts that access ChatGPT through certain VPNs. The keyword here is “may,” as some people can use a VPN and have no issues with ChatGPT.</p><p> If you experience a block while using a VPN, the first step is to turn off the VPN and attempt to access ChatGPT without it. In most cases, disabling the VPN will instantly resolve the issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Creating-Multiple-Accounts-on-the-Free-Tier"><a href="#3-Creating-Multiple-Accounts-on-the-Free-Tier" class="headerlink" title="3. Creating Multiple Accounts on the Free Tier"></a>3. Creating Multiple Accounts on the Free Tier</h2><p> OpenAI allows users to have one account per individual on the free tier. Creating multiple accounts violates this policy and can cause the blocking of your ChatGPT account. The free tier of ChatGPT allows anyone to use the service but is sometimes unavailable because of high traffic.</p><p> When this happens, creating multiple accounts to gain access to the service may be tempting. But this is a bad idea and can lead to your ChatGPT account being blocked.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Using-ChatGPT-in-a-Way-That-Poses-Risk-to-Others"><a href="#4-Using-ChatGPT-in-a-Way-That-Poses-Risk-to-Others" class="headerlink" title="4.

ChatGPT can craft clear and concise emails. However, it’s essential to verify the accuracy of the information provided.</p><p> When writing professional emails, remember to give ChatGPT the necessary context. Are you talking to a client or a team member? What details do you want included in your email? However, don’t give complex instructions, which is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-mistakes-to-avoid/" >ChatGPT prompt mistakes to avoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> If you’re concerned about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/protect-privacy-using-chatgpt-for-work/" >protecting your privacy while using ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can ask the AI to write a generic email as we did in the prompt in the photo below.

Use ChatGPT for Problem-Solving and Decision-Making</h2><p> Many freelance workers run their businesses as sole proprietors to keep expenses low. You might find yourself struggling with problems or making critical decisions independently. Thankfully, ChatGPT can serve as your trusted partner in these situations. Whether you need guidance on a tough decision or run into a challenging problem, ChatGPT can provide insights and suggestions to help you take action.</p><p> ChatGPT’s responses are currently based on a September 2021 knowledge cut-off, but the AI can still give you practical tips and advice for simple technical concerns, as shown in the photo below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-06t182610-543.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT gives tips on troubleshooting bluetooth connectivity"                ></p><p> Example prompts:</p><ul><li>“ChatGPT, my Bluetooth devices can’t connect to Windows 10.

Many freelancers need to upskill to remain relevant in a world where artificial intelligence is gaining ground. Ironically, AI or ChatGPT itself can accelerate your learning journey.</p><p> ChatGPT can be your virtual tutor, offering general information on various topics.

You can use it to generate ideas, blog outlines, or even entire blocks of text.</p><p> Generating fresh ideas is one of the most important tasks of freelancers and remote workers in leadership roles or those in the creative industry. With ChatGPT, you can quickly combat creative block. It can be your brainstorming partner, helping you view a topic from different angles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-06t183915-157.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt provides topics on freelancing in the age of artificial intelligence"                ></p><p> Remember that ChatGPT can also give very generic results if you’re using it to write content. This is why you should view it as a tool rather than a replacement. Always edit and proofread ChatGPT answers. Check for tone and word choice, as its responses can sound impersonal and robotic unless you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/" >train ChatGPT to write like you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Example prompts:</p><ul><li>“Brainstorm topics related to freelancing in the age of artificial intelligence.”</li><li>“Create a blog outline for my article on [topic].”</li><li>“Please review this paragraph and suggest revisions.

Use ChatGPT for Editing, Proofreading, and Translation"></a>5. Use ChatGPT for Editing, Proofreading, and Translation</h2><p> ChatGPT can help you edit and proofread you content. Unlike Grammarly, ChatGPT can revise your content to fit a variety of styles and tones. It can be your language support tool, assisting with grammar checks and providing detailed critiques to improve your writing.</p><p> In the photo below, we asked ChatGPT to review an article draft. You don’t have to apply all of ChatGPT’s suggestions, but the comments are a good starting point for feedback before submitting work to clients.</p><h1 id="chatgpt-gives-suggestions-to-improve-an-article"><a href="#chatgpt-gives-suggestions-to-improve-an-article" class="headerlink" title="chatgpt gives suggestions to improve an article"></a>chatgpt gives suggestions to improve an article</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amplify-2023-10-06t190137-806.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt gives suggestions to improve an article"                ></p><p> You can also <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-translate-with-chatgpt/" >use ChatGPT as a language-translation tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Tools like Google Translate attempt to bridge language barriers. However, you can’t interact with Google Translate in the same way you can converse with ChatGPT. By providing context, asking follow-up questions, or offering additional information, you can get more accurate results with ChatGPT.</p><p> Currently, we don’t suggest using ChatGPT to translate content for distribution to your colleagues or teammates. Like other apps, it still can’t fully capture the nuances of certain expressions. If you can’t edit or proofread in the translated language or find someone who can, it’s better to use ChatGPT for simple language queries.</p><p> Example prompts:</p><ul><li>“ChatGPT, check this document for grammar and language errors.”</li><li>“Revise these social media captions. Use a witty and funny tone.”</li><li>“Review this blog I wrote for a nonprofit. The goal is to get new donors for our new project. In what ways can I improve it?”</li><li>“My Filipino colleague just asked me ‘Hoy! Kamusta kana’.

ChatGPT can support your well-being by engaging in casual conversation, offering motivational messages, or suggesting self-care practices.</p><p> Of course, AI can’t replace the comforting presence of another human being. But if you can’t find anyone to talk to, you can temporarily <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-chatgpt-safely-mental-health-coach/" >use ChatGPT safely as your mental health coach <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There are numerous ways to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT to help you in your freelance or remote tasks.</p><p> The versatile and interactive features of ChatGPT make it an ideal assistant.

Is Grok Better Than ChatGPT?"></a>How Does Grok Perform? Is Grok Better Than ChatGPT?</h2><p> Given only a minute number of users have been given access to Grok so far, most of what we know about its performance comes from xAI. The company was keen to stress that “Grok is still a very early beta product” and that its current performance is “the best we could do with 2 months of training.”</p><p> Even so, Grok appears to be on the right track. According to xAI’s research, its prototype Grok-0 model was trained using 33 billion parameters and outperformed the Llama 2 70 billion parameter model in standardized machine learning benchmarking and testing. After some tweaks (and presumably an expanded set of parameters), Grok-1 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (around 175 billion parameters).</p><p> However, in a further boon to Musk and Grok, during a final round of testing on the 2023 Hungarian National High School Final Exams in Mathematics (yes, obscure, but purposefully so to avoid the chance the data has been uploaded to an existing LLM, which would give it an advantage), Grok came second only to OpenAI’s GPT-4.</p><p> Musk has also observed that Grok’s direct internet access will give it an advantage over other generative AI tools that lack access.</p><p> Currently, it’s difficult to say whether Grok is better than ChatGPT, and it’s clear that Grok is speeding forward based on the work already laid out by other AI research companies.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Will-Grok-Cost-Who-Can-Use-Grok-2"><a href="#How-Much-Will-Grok-Cost-Who-Can-Use-Grok-2" class="headerlink" title="How Much Will Grok Cost? Who Can Use Grok?"></a>How Much Will Grok Cost? Who Can Use Grok?</h2><p> Grok is still currently in early testing. Limited beta access has been granted to a small number of X Premium Plus users, which currently costs $16 per month. Once Grok leaves its beta period, it will become available to all X Premium Plus subscribers, dangling a weighty AI-shaped carrot over X verification.</p><p> It’s currently unknown if Grok will come with a free access tier, which all other major generative AI tools offer. For example, OpenAI keeps its less-powerful ChatGPT-3.5 model free, while Anthropic offers a free version of Claude. Restricting Grok to X’s verified paying customers is unlikely to pay the bill, especially given X’s drop off in user numbers since Musk’s takeover.</p><p> I would expect xAI to release an earlier version of Grok for free, or at least, much cheaper, in the hope that it encourages users to upgrade to the full version. Another issue that may stand in the way of Grok uptake is its current direct link to X Premium Plus.

For a creative writer, it can be a great deal of help in multiple ways. From generating ideas for overcoming writer’s block to researching themes for your next story, ChatGPT is the perfect assistant.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But, can it help with the entire process of creating a poetry book? If you ask the right questions, there’s no reason why it can’t.</p><p> Below is a guide on how to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT to write a poetry book, from brainstorming to publication.</p><h2 id="Brainstorm-Ideas"><a href="#Brainstorm-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Brainstorm Ideas"></a>Brainstorm Ideas</h2><p> The beginning of every poetry book needs one thing: poems. Many times, the poems can be based on one theme or showcase a storyline.</p><p> To write poetry, though, you have to be in the right emotional headspace for it. If you’re not, it can be a bit difficult to scribe lines.</p><p> ChatGPT can help with that. Brainstorming ideas can come in the nature of prompts, collaboration, and even sharing other poetry to inspire your thought process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39655089&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/wa/01_WA_728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-topics.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT poetry topics to choose from"                ></p><p> If you’re curious about what topic your poetry should focus on, ask ChatGPT for a list of themes and pick which ones resonate with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-prompt.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT poetry prompt"                ></p><p> You may already know what theme you’re going for. If so, you can ask for prompts about that theme or have ChatGPT ask you questions to help refine your ideas. The questions should be thought-provoking to help you infuse as much emotion into your work as you can. Remember, AI can’t feel, so it’s up to you to make your readers feel your art.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-new-approach.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT new poetric approach prompt"                ></p><p> If you really want to test your poetic abilities, ask the AI to suggest a new poetic approach with steps to help guide you. Even if it doesn’t make it to a final draft, it’s still a good exercise to enhance your writing abilities.</p><h2 id="Help-With-Language-and-Style"><a href="#Help-With-Language-and-Style" class="headerlink" title="Help With Language and Style"></a>Help With Language and Style</h2><p> There are so many <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-openai/" >creative ways that ChatGPT can be used <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Helping to build poems with fluid language and style is one of them.</p><p> Having refined language and style in a poem helps to express your ideas and emotions to your readers. If it’s inconsistent and hard to understand, your readers won’t be able to keep up with the art you’re trying to create in your book.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-poetic-device.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT Poetic Device option"                ></p><p> Using poetic devices can help to make a good poem great. Ask ChatGPT for a poetic device that will fit within the poem structure you’re going for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-imagery.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT poetry imagery word options"                ></p><p> You can also ask ChatGPT for some good imagery words that align with the subject of your poem. For example, if you’re writing about the moon’s reflection on top of the water, but you’re having a hard time with wording, you can choose from a list offered by the AI.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Offer-Alternative-Word-Choices"><a href="#Offer-Alternative-Word-Choices" class="headerlink" title="Offer Alternative Word Choices"></a>Offer Alternative Word Choices</h2><p> The thesaurus is every writer’s best friend when they can’t think of the right words to use.

The unique ChatGPT URL can be shared just as any other URL, effectively replacing the cumbersome method of sharing a screenshot and a specific prompt.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-ChatGPT-Shared-Links-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ChatGPT-Shared-Links-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ChatGPT Shared Links Work?"></a>How Do ChatGPT Shared Links Work?</h2><p> At the time of writing, ChatGPT shared links are still rolling out.

You share the link, and the person with the URL can see what you’ve shared.</p><p> In the ChatGPT web browser (there is currently no iOS support for shared links), you’ll note a new icon in your chat history.

Now, before you share, you can choose to share with your name or to share anonymously. Switching between the two is useful, as anyone with the ChatGPT shared link URL can gain access. However, “shared links are not designed to show up in public search results on the internet,” which is also good to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-shared-urls-anonymous-link.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt shared urls anonymous link"                ></p><h3 id="Other-Users-Can-Continue-Your-ChatGPT-Conversation"><a href="#Other-Users-Can-Continue-Your-ChatGPT-Conversation" class="headerlink" title="Other Users Can Continue Your ChatGPT Conversation"></a>Other Users Can Continue Your ChatGPT Conversation</h3><p> Furthermore, anyone with the URL can continue the shared ChatGPT conversation. As per OpenAI, “think of a shared link as a snapshot of a conversation up to the point at which you generate the shared link.” From the moment it is shared, anyone with the link can take on the conversation as if it was their own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-shared-urls-continue-conversation.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt shared urls continue conversation"                ></p><p> The updated conversation won’t appear in your ChatGPT history.

ChatGPT developers, OpenAI, have taken this onboard, and the shared links make it much easier to share ChatGPT conversations.</p><p> At the time of writing, ChatGPT shared functionality is somewhat limited. Future updates are likely to bring additional controls, specifically with regards to limiting permissions. We could also see other changes, like timed links that expire after a certain period or ways to work collaboratively through a single URL. But this is all speculation!</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But how do ChatGPT shared links work, and when should you use them?</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

Probably every writer has heard about them. Global tech giants made headlines by releasing AI-driven chatbots, e.g., ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Despite AI being innovative, it isn’t always beneficial. Here are some ways AI chatbots have been positive and negative for professionals in the content industry.</p><h2 id="1-AI-Minimizes-Grammatical-Errors"><a href="#1-AI-Minimizes-Grammatical-Errors" class="headerlink" title="1. AI Minimizes Grammatical Errors"></a>1. AI Minimizes Grammatical Errors</h2><p> AI chatbots have come a long way from producing incoherent text. Nowadays, advanced LLMs produce grammatically correct outputs on any topic under the sun. You could even ask them to adopt a specific tone.</p><p> Apart from producing grammatically correct text, chatbots assist with edits and corrections. Many professionals use them as free alternatives to grammar checkers. LLMs can spot grammatical errors, text inconsistencies, run-on sentences, misspelled words, and awkward phrasing.</p><p> The below image shows ChatGPT suggesting text corrections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-spotting-spelling-errors.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Edit Text and Spot Grammar Errors"                ></p><p> Bing Chat provides more accurate results by referencing other grammar checkers in real-time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><h3 id="200610"><a class="link"   href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/200610/3022" >Parental Control Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><span class="text-ad-content">    #1 Rated Parental Control Software.<br/>    Monitor & Control all PC Activity!<br/>        <cite style="color:green">sentrypc.com/parental-controls/</cite>    </span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/200610/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->![Bing Chat Edits Paragraphs by Quillbot's Standards](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-edits-text.jpg)<p> You’ll find many <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-grammar-checker/" >reliable grammar checkers online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but full-suite plans often come with monthly subscriptions. Free accounts get limited checks. On Grammarly, users can’t even unlock advanced suggestions until they upgrade to a Premium plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Poorly-Researched-Articles-Spread-Misinformation"><a href="#2-Poorly-Researched-Articles-Spread-Misinformation" class="headerlink" title="2.

Poorly Researched Articles Spread Misinformation</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >One of the biggest problems with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bing Chat, among other platforms, is that they don’t double-check facts. They merely present what they know. ChatGPT formulates answers from datasets, and Bing Chat runs search queries, but neither performs fact-checking.</p><p> For instance, the below photo shows that ChatGPT doesn’t know its own launch date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-stating-incorrect-information.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Answering Question About Itself Wrong"                ></p><p> Despite these limitations, some writers wholly depend on ChatGPT for topic research. They want quick, convenient answers. However, you can’t replace proper research with AI chatbot conversations. You’ll end up publishing incorrect information.</p><p> Many shady AI writers actually draw flak for spreading misinformation. Only use chatbots for preliminary research. Ask them to break down complex subjects before diving into academic journals and scholarly papers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Generic-AI-Generated-Articles-Flood-SERPs"><a href="#3-Generic-AI-Generated-Articles-Flood-SERPs" class="headerlink" title="3.

AI writers use the time and effort they save to improve their SEO, boosting page visibility. Some of them even utilize backlinks to fake authoritativeness.</p><p> SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) are flooded with low-effort AI content that comprises generic, simplistic insights. They touch on topics but never explain them. Readers only gain a basic, surface-level understanding of subjects from these articles.</p><p> The upside is that Google rewards well-researched content. Googlebot eventually replaces ranking AI articles that provide no added value to readers. Even results on page one could quickly drop. Just keep publishing quality pieces.

Widely used options like <a class="link"   href="https://ahrefs.com/" >Ahrefs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://semrush.sjv.io/c/119570/995972/13053?subId1=UUmuoUeUpU2024741&subId2=emuo&u=https://www.semrush.com/" >Semrush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could set you back by hundreds a month. The fees don’t make sense unless you run all their features.</p><p> If you need basic SEO keyword research and analytics, use AI chatbots instead. We suggest Bing Chat since it’s connected to the internet. It references popular SEO tools to give you real-time SEO analytics.</p><p> The below image shows Bing Chat’s keyword research on AI.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-doing-seo-keyword-research.jpg"                      alt="Bing Chat Suggesting Keywords Based on Your Topic"                ></p><p> Since Bing Chat wasn’t designed for SEO research, you must phrase your prompts properly. Don’t just say you need SEO analytics. Ask for specific data, like top-ranking LSI keywords, search volume analytics, and market trends.</p><h2 id="5-Content-Mills-Publish-AI-Generated-Articles-in-Masses"><a href="#5-Content-Mills-Publish-AI-Generated-Articles-in-Masses" class="headerlink" title="5.

Content Mills Publish AI-Generated Articles in Masses</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-writing-1-000-word-article.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to Write a 1,000 word Article on AI"                ></p><p> Content mills have always prioritized quantity over quality. But with the availability of AI-driven chatbots, they further sped up the writing process at no extra cost. It’s common for them to publish hundreds of AI content daily.</p><p> Most mills work around plagiarism and copyright infringement laws by hiring human editors. They pay chump change for quick, low-effort edits. Their sole purpose is to alter outputs so that their clients don’t flag them for plagiarism.</p><p> Avoid content mills like the plague. They pay industry-low rates, set unrealistic output expectations, and place zero value on quality writing. Your writing career won’t progress while working for them.</p><h2 id="6-Plagiarism-Has-Become-More-Widespread"><a href="#6-Plagiarism-Has-Become-More-Widespread" class="headerlink" title="6. Plagiarism Has Become More Widespread"></a>6. Plagiarism Has Become More Widespread</h2><p> Plagiarism has become more widespread recently. Remember: AI repeats answers. So if multiple writers were to discuss one topic, their articles would share the same angle, structure, outline, and theme. Some writers rephrase texts to avoid getting flagged for plagiarism.</p><p> But since they also use publicly available paraphrasing tools, Google still detects their template outputs. Their sites quickly lose authority afterwards. You can’t cheat the system. To produce original pieces with unique insights, research various official and non-official sources.</p><h2 id="7-More-Articles-Share-Similar-Angles"><a href="#7-More-Articles-Share-Similar-Angles" class="headerlink" title="7. More Articles Share Similar Angles"></a>7. More Articles Share Similar Angles</h2><p> AI chatbots produce template responses. They pull information from the exact datasets even if you regenerate responses several times. Take the below conversation as an example. This photo shows ChatGPT answering a general knowledge question about AI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-answers-general-knowledge-question-about-ai.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Answering a Basic Question General Kowledge Question About AI"                ></p><p> We started a new chat and reused our prompt, but ChatGPT provided identical facts.

AI Chatbots Commodify Subpar Content"></a>8. AI Chatbots Commodify Subpar Content</h2><p> As content mills bombard readers with AI-generated pieces, other publications are forced to fight back. Even global media publishers invest in writing tools nowadays. Some use them ironically, while others churn out content to stay relevant.</p><p> To make matters worse, fake gurus encourage unsuspecting newbies to exploit AI-driven platforms. They make the practice seem normal, even if it’s not. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/copyright-rules-ai-art/" >AI content falls outside of copyright protection laws <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Since you can’t claim ownership, using them commercially could have legal consequences.</p><p> Also, AI writing tools are unsustainable. <a class="link"   href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> prioritizes authoritative websites that publish well-researched articles—it might start cracking down on AI content soon.

AI is inherently unbiased. Instead of criticizing chatbots, blame writers for exploiting them. Harmful, plagiarized, and damaging output stem from human prejudices—machines only respond to input.</p><p> Writers should learn to use AI responsibly. Find out about platforms that can help you find typos, research topics, outline articles, and analyze SEO keywords. Automate rote work whenever possible. Free up your time for writing tasks that require critical thinking and creativity.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Despite AI being innovative, it isn’t always beneficial.

Any other domain containing “ChatGPT” probably isn’t associated with OpenAI. It might be a real website offering a genuine service, but it’s unlikely that OpenAI owns it.</p><p> As per Checkpoint, one out of every 25 newly registered domain names associated with ChatGPT were malicious. Some of the malicious examples included:</p><ul><li>chat-gpt-pc.online</li><li>chat-gpt-online-pc.com</li><li>chatgpt4beta.com</li><li>chatgptdetectors.com</li><li>chat-gpt-ai-pc.info</li><li>chat-gpt-for-windows.com</li></ul><p> All are seemingly linked to ChatGPT; all are completely fake.</p><h3 id="Website-Design-and-Layout"><a href="#Website-Design-and-Layout" class="headerlink" title="Website Design and Layout"></a>Website Design and Layout</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-s-homepage-displayed-on-a-laptop-screen.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT&#39;s homepage displayed on a laptop screen"                ></p><p> Phishing websites often mimic the design of official ChatGPT or OpenAI websites. Using the official layout, they mislead users into believing they are buying a product from the official site.</p><p> If the domain name of a website has the word “ChatGPT” in it, and the website looks like a clone of the official website, it is most likely a phishing site.</p><p> If a website contains the word “ChatGPT,” but its design or layout is completely different from the official site, it could be a genuine service website.

If the content is poorly written or contains grammatical errors, scammers probably operate the website.</li><li>If the website creates an urgency to buy a product, such as by showing a countdown, don’t buy anything from it.</li><li>Google sometimes warns users when they visit highly reported websites. If you receive such a warning, stay away from the website.</li><li>If there is no padlock symbol beside the website URL and you see “Non-secure” written there, the website doesn’t have the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ssl-certificate-need-one/" >SSL-protection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a phishing sign.  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/official-chatgpt-website-with-https-lock.jpg"                      alt="official chatgpt website with https lock"                ></li><li>Search using the website’s URL on Google or any other search engine.

Do not use your personal information, not even to log in, and do not use credit cards or other financial information. Also, avoid downloading attachments or clicking website links.</p><p> Besides that, post about the website with its URL in a public forum (somewhere like Reddit or X) and explain why you believe it is suspicious. It will prevent other users from falling victim to it and maybe encourage a security researcher to investigate it.</p><h2 id="Already-Fallen-Victim-to-a-ChatGPT-Phishing-Website-Here’s-What-to-Do-Next"><a href="#Already-Fallen-Victim-to-a-ChatGPT-Phishing-Website-Here’s-What-to-Do-Next" class="headerlink" title="Already Fallen Victim to a ChatGPT Phishing Website?

All you have to do is leave the website and never visit it again.</li><li>If you have purchased a product or subscribed to a service on the phishing website and realized it too late, immediately contact your credit card company or bank for a refund and request they monitor your account for suspicious activity.</li></ul><p> Websites without SSL certificates are mainly used to steal your personal information and then sell it to scammers. Therefore, if you’ve used your credit card on a shady website, request your bank or company to freeze it. If you have signed up on the fraudulent website with your primary email ID or phone number, watch out for phishing emails or phone calls going forward, and change any passwords you use.</p><p> Inform the appropriate authorities about any breaches of personal (and crucial) information you mistakenly share on the website, including your social security number, name, address, etc. This will save you from legal repercussions if scammers illegally misuse your information.</p><p> If you have downloaded an attachment disguised as an important document or file, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-malware-using-microsoft-defenders-offline-scan/" >scan your device for malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to ensure it hasn’t been infected.

How can they seem almost indistinguishable from a regular person sitting at a keyboard?</p><p> In November 2022, OpenAI released a publically accessible version of its GPT-3.5 large language model named ChatGPT. This was the first AI chatbot to showcase an ability to simulate very human-like conversations. We have a dedicated article <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/" >explaining ChatGPT in-depth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but there are some important pointers to note here.</p><p> Firstly, the “GPT” element of the tool’s name stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” which is a kind of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language model (LLM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You may have seen both these terms thrown around a lot through 2023, but what do they actually mean?</p><p> An LLM is an AI learning model used by all the major AI chatbots you see today. It is powered by an AI algorithm that uses deep learning to operate on an incredibly complex level. All LLMs are trained with very large datasets, giving them a huge reservoir of knowledge to solve issues and respond to queries. ChatGPT-4, for example, was trained with between 1 trillion and 1.7 trillion parameters and terabytes of data (though OpenAI hasn’t revealed exactly how much).</p><p> A GPT is a specific type of LLM comprising a neural network capable of deep learning. GPTs are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-pre-trained-model-work-business/" >pre-trained models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> given huge databases of information to learn from. In ChatGPT’s case, this includes text from books, journals, articles, and more. But even with all this data, how does ChatGPT talk to people in a human-like way?</p><p> During ChatGPT’s development, it was trained using the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method. This form of training uses reinforcement to mold ChatGPT into the desired chatbot. With a reward and feedback model, ChatGPT can understand which responses are useful or “good” and which are not. This method also allows ChatGPT to grasp conversational context better, meaning it can answer prompts more effectively.</p><p> ChatGPT’s natural language processing also plays a big role in how it responds to users, including recognizing specific language patterns and sentiments. In its training, the algorithm was provided with examples of human conversations to better understand how humans communicate. The algorithm can even keep note of cues, like greetings and farewells, to monitor the stage of the conversation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Are-AI-Chatbots-Advancing"><a href="#How-Are-AI-Chatbots-Advancing" class="headerlink" title="How Are AI Chatbots Advancing?"></a>How Are AI Chatbots Advancing?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatbot-help-hand.jpg"                      alt="digital graphic of chatbot hologram above person&#39;s open hand"                ></p><p>Image Credit: Thanakorn Lappattara&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/25075224-artificial-intelligence-communication-and-interaction-with-technology-big-data-collection-to-process-results-chatbot-chat-with-ai-information-exchange-technology-automated-robotic" >Vecteezy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> OpenAI has released limited information on GPT-5, the next iteration of its LLM. What’s particularly exciting about GPT-5 (on top of its more up-to-date knowledge base) is that it is rumored to incorporate <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-how-it-differs-generative-ai/" >artificial general intelligence (AGI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> into its algorithm. Given that AGI should theoretically be able to simulate human cognition, this may be a game changer.</p><p> ChatGPT took the world by storm and continues to do so, but AI chatbots don’t end with OpenAI. Companies worldwide are working to improve their AI chatbots to simulate conversations with people, with some AI chatbots taking things to a physical level.</p><p> Take Desdemona, for example, a humanoid robot model that uses AI to communicate.</p><p> Created by Hanson Robotics and SingularityNET, Desdemona is the “sister” of the well-known robot Sophia, who has hit many major news headlines for her impressive yet eerie human-like features and temperament.</p><p> Unlike Sophia, Desdemona focuses on music and is even part of a band with other human musicians. The AI algorithm draws from a library of preexisting music, allowing Desdemona to sing along to popular songs. The robot has even performed live with her bandmates.</p><p> But Desdemona can also talk and hold conversations with people. In 2022, Desdemona was interviewed by YouTube creator Discover Crypto, wherein the creator of her AI algorithm, Ben Goertzel, also answered some questions on AI and its future.</p><p> Desdemona’s long-standing joke about keeping humans in aquariums may be unsettling to some, but her ability to respond to non-rehearsed prompts shows the potential AI has to interact with humans in a friendly and conversational manner.</p><h2 id="AI-Is-Only-Getting-Smarter"><a href="#AI-Is-Only-Getting-Smarter" class="headerlink" title="AI Is Only Getting Smarter"></a>AI Is Only Getting Smarter</h2><p> Over the past decade, huge strides have been made in the AI field, with chatbots now being able to tell jokes, write essays, translate languages, and provide a huge amount of information. Above all, they have the incredible ability to simulate human conversations. One day, we may see chatbots surpass human ability, but for now, there’s a lot of room for improvement.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Chatbots have been a quirky yet useful online tool for some time.

But even with all this data, how does ChatGPT talk to people in a human-like way?</p><p> During ChatGPT’s development, it was trained using the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method. This form of training uses reinforcement to mold ChatGPT into the desired chatbot. With a reward and feedback model, ChatGPT can understand which responses are useful or “good” and which are not. This method also allows ChatGPT to grasp conversational context better, meaning it can answer prompts more effectively.</p><p> ChatGPT’s natural language processing also plays a big role in how it responds to users, including recognizing specific language patterns and sentiments. In its training, the algorithm was provided with examples of human conversations to better understand how humans communicate. The algorithm can even keep note of cues, like greetings and farewells, to monitor the stage of the conversation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Are-AI-Chatbots-Advancing-3"><a href="#How-Are-AI-Chatbots-Advancing-3" class="headerlink" title="How Are AI Chatbots Advancing?"></a>How Are AI Chatbots Advancing?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatbot-help-hand.jpg"                      alt="digital graphic of chatbot hologram above person&#39;s open hand"                ></p><p>Image Credit: Thanakorn Lappattara&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/25075224-artificial-intelligence-communication-and-interaction-with-technology-big-data-collection-to-process-results-chatbot-chat-with-ai-information-exchange-technology-automated-robotic" >Vecteezy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> OpenAI has released limited information on GPT-5, the next iteration of its LLM. What’s particularly exciting about GPT-5 (on top of its more up-to-date knowledge base) is that it is rumored to incorporate <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-how-it-differs-generative-ai/" >artificial general intelligence (AGI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> into its algorithm. Given that AGI should theoretically be able to simulate human cognition, this may be a game changer.</p><p> ChatGPT took the world by storm and continues to do so, but AI chatbots don’t end with OpenAI. Companies worldwide are working to improve their AI chatbots to simulate conversations with people, with some AI chatbots taking things to a physical level.</p><p> Take Desdemona, for example, a humanoid robot model that uses AI to communicate.</p><p> Created by Hanson Robotics and SingularityNET, Desdemona is the “sister” of the well-known robot Sophia, who has hit many major news headlines for her impressive yet eerie human-like features and temperament.</p><p> Unlike Sophia, Desdemona focuses on music and is even part of a band with other human musicians. The AI algorithm draws from a library of preexisting music, allowing Desdemona to sing along to popular songs. The robot has even performed live with her bandmates.</p><p> But Desdemona can also talk and hold conversations with people. In 2022, Desdemona was interviewed by YouTube creator Discover Crypto, wherein the creator of her AI algorithm, Ben Goertzel, also answered some questions on AI and its future.</p><p> Desdemona’s long-standing joke about keeping humans in aquariums may be unsettling to some, but her ability to respond to non-rehearsed prompts shows the potential AI has to interact with humans in a friendly and conversational manner.</p><h2 id="AI-Is-Only-Getting-Smarter-3"><a href="#AI-Is-Only-Getting-Smarter-3" class="headerlink" title="AI Is Only Getting Smarter"></a>AI Is Only Getting Smarter</h2><p> Over the past decade, huge strides have been made in the AI field, with chatbots now being able to tell jokes, write essays, translate languages, and provide a huge amount of information. Above all, they have the incredible ability to simulate human conversations. One day, we may see chatbots surpass human ability, but for now, there’s a lot of room for improvement.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) joins the Kinesis keyboard family with its easy-to-use modular design. Better yet, this ergonomic keyboard supports up to three connected devices at a time, allowing you to easily swap between a Mac, iPhone, or iPad with the press of a few hotkeys. With its compact build, the Kinesis Freestyle2 is a welcome addition to any Apple user’s collection, whether they’re at home or on the go, thanks to the excellent battery life of up to 300 plus hours of extended use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold"></a><strong>Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold</strong></h2><p> For people who are tethered to their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/computer-and-laptop-reviews-4102643" >computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ergonomic keyboards are a must. These keyboards tend to be large thanks to the frequently employed swoop design that opens up the keys to provide additional spacing, so fingers feel less cramped, and a wrist-friendly position that prevents<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while typing. These keyboards are typically space hogs, taking up large portions of any surface that they’re placed on, often forcing users to reach further for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-mice-6666207" >mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can lead to shoulder injuries in place of wrist injuries—a trade-off no one wants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C-YK_WPWu8Ujx1fwDLxvO6Epi-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_05-adcddc5fc05b415dbcd82396bc0ada77.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac breaks free of these norms by using a split, modular design that features two keyboard halves, one for each hand, connected via a 9 or 20-inch cable depending upon the chosen model. These pieces were designed with comfort in mind. They may be used separately or connected with a pivot tether at the top of the two halves. This allows you the opportunity to customize your setup and maximize your comfort, whether that’s by placing the halves closer together or further apart.</p><p> The Freestyle2’s minimum size is 15.4 inches in length, but it can extend to a maximum length of 23.5 inches (37.75 inches for the 20-inch model). It uses a standard key layout, so it’s familiar and easy to adjust to, while the low-impact design means that the keys need less pressure to type and are quieter. Additionally, its backside is free of risers letting your wrists sit in a neutral, comfortable position that helps prevent injuries over time.</p><p> Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300-plus hours of regular use.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack. Whether you’re commuting between the home and the office or you’re heading out of town for a vacation, it’s easy to break down and bring anywhere so long as there’s a flat surface to place it during use.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only"><a href="#Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: For Apple products only"></a><strong>Setup Process: For Apple products only</strong></h2><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue arrives with the two keyboard halves, the instructional pamphlet, and a six-foot USB charging cable.

First, we flipped the switch on the right-hand side of the keyboard from the off position to the on position. Then, we flipped the keyboard over and pressed the connect button on the backside. We knew it was ready to begin pairing when the lights on the frontside began flashing blue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4737285&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/b2f83c409ce63012229fb9cd465bdcfe/products/copy_reporting_system.png"                      border="0"                >  KoolReport Pro  is an advanced solution for creating data reports and dashboards in PHP.

These make it simple to copy, paste, cut, go back or forward in a browser, or even switch between the keyboard’s connected devices smoothly and efficiently. They take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it using them is a breeze.</p><p> One pet peeve we had with the keyboard design was the Caps lock key. Instead of having a light on the button itself that glows when the function is enabled, this light is placed alongside the Bluetooth connectivity lights on the right-hand side of the keyboard. While this isn’t the end of the world by any means, it’s less intuitive since you need to retrain yourself on where to look to see if it’s enabled. Additionally, you should be aware that leaving this button on or using it frequently can lead to faster battery drain.</p><p> Its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys.</p><h2 id="Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind"><a href="#Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind"></a><strong>Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Freestyle2 is excellent. It arrives with a partial charge, so it’s important to remember to fully charge it after receiving it. Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300 plus hours of regular use. The Freestyle2 does an excellent job of letting you know when its battery is getting low—battery lights will flash red to indicate when there are about four hours of battery life remaining. This ensures you’re never left hanging.</p><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the features"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the features</strong></h2><p> Full-size ergonomic keyboards tend to retail anywhere from $50 to $200, depending on the features involved. Generally retailing for about $100 on Amazon, the Freestyle2 sits comfortably at the front of this curve. While $100 may seem expensive for a keyboard, consider the features involved. Its travel-friendly build, adjustable setup options, extended battery life, and ability to switch quickly and smoothly between multiple connected devices make it an excellent choice for the features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vncgu0FEgBJ69UL6H8BjQ2QoGRI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_03-9055476d1d974c8bbe9b1c39d479b300.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> Not all keyboards are created equal, and while the split, modular design offered by the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue creates wonderful customization options, there’s something to be said for having a full keyboard. For Apple users willing to take a leap into Microsoft products, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard shines through as an excellent option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While it may seem odd to lean into Microsoft products for Mac lovers, its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys. It also arrives with a mouse and detached numpad, which are some nice perks as the Freestyle2 doesn’t include the numpad, although it is available as an accessory for an additional $40. The Windows key may also be mapped to the command key on the Sculpt. Generally retailing for about $80-$120, the Sculpt is around the same price as the Kinesis.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack.</p><p> One drawback to this device is that the receiver dongle used to pair the Sculpt to your computer is associated with the keyboard at the factory. This is because the keyboard features encryption technology in order to protect your keystrokes. If this dongle is lost, there simply is no replacing it. With this information in mind, this keyboard would do best in an environment where it stays put rather than the Freestyle2 which is much more travel-friendly thanks to its compact nature and Bluetooth pairing capabilities.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ideal keyboard for Apple users with its compact design, portability, and long-lasting battery.</strong></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac is a compact, user-friendly ergonomic keyboard that takes comfort and customization to the next level for Apple users thanks to its split, modular design. Its extended battery life of up to 300 plus hours combined with its ability to connect to multiple iOS devices at a time is a game-changer, making it well worth the splurge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

However, like any powerful technology, AI language models can be misused.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Before you take this issue lightly, know that misusing AI can lead to legal issues, reputational damage, and erroneous output. Let’s explore the wrong ways content creators use ChatGPT so that you can avoid these problems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Don’t-Overdepend-on-ChatGPT"><a href="#1-Don’t-Overdepend-on-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Overdepend on ChatGPT"></a>1. Don’t Overdepend on ChatGPT</h2><p> Imagine you’re a first-time ChatGPT user. Since it’s your first time using it, you’ll find its speed remarkable. What once took you hours to create only takes seconds. As time goes by, you might start heavily relying on it. You make a few edits but don’t bother to research.</p><p> This phenomenon is what you call overdependence on AI, and it’s a tempting path to take for creators who are pushed to produce output rapidly. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2022/06/Aether-Overreliance-on-AI-Review-Final-6.21.22.pdf" >Microsoft’s literature review on AI overreliance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> warns that overdepending on AI leads you to accept erroneous results.</p><p> Take the CNET controversy as an example. CNET published financial explainer articles written by AI under the unassuming byline “CNET Money Staff.” Unfortunately for CNET, <a class="link"   href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai" >Futurism <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> spotted glaring errors in the AI-generated articles. It called out the media outfit for publishing horrible financial advice and mass-producing cheap content to manipulate Google search results for profit.</p><p> We don’t know if CNET suffered from overdependence on AI or overconfidence that nobody would notice. Regardless, the incident should serve as a warning to not over-rely on AI’s glib output.</p><p> Remember that it’s possible for ChatGPT to churn out outdated information. As ChatGPT itself says, its knowledge cutoff is only up to September 2021, so it’s always good to double-check the information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-50.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT reminds user to double check information it provides"                ></p><p> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also mentions in an <a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=540vzMlf-54" >ABC News video interview <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that users should be more cautious about ChatGPT’s “hallucinations problem.” It can confidently state made-up ideas as if they were facts. A single incident like CNET’s can damage your credibility as an authoritative source.</p><p> It’s easy to blindly accept ChatGPT’s output when you don’t have enough knowledge to evaluate the results. Moreover, you might not bother to check a different point of view when ChatGPT’s answers align with your beliefs. To avoid these embarrassing situations, fact-check, seek multiple perspectives, and get expert advice.</p><p> If you’re learning to use ChatGPT for content creation, include <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >what AI hallucination is and how you can spot it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your list of topics to master. More importantly, don’t disregard human judgment and creativity. Remember, AI should augment your thinking and not replace it.</p><h2 id="2-Don’t-Ask-ChatGPT-for-Research-Links"><a href="#2-Don’t-Ask-ChatGPT-for-Research-Links" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Ask ChatGPT for Research Links"></a>2. Don’t Ask ChatGPT for Research Links</h2><p> You’d likely be disappointed if you asked ChatGPT for internet links to research sources. ChatGPT will give you links, but they will be the wrong ones or not necessarily the best ones on the web.</p><p> To test, we asked ChatGPT to give us JSTOR research paper links on British young adult fantasy writers who have written coming-of-age stories. The AI gave us five resources with titles, volume numbers, page numbers, and authors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-46.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT giving JSTOR links to wrong resources"                ></p><p> At first glance, the list looks credible. The JSTOR articles have impressive-sounding titles like “Constructing Hybrid Identity: Race and Nation in Sally Green’s Half Bad Trilogy.” But a Google search would quickly show that most links lead to the wrong JSTOR articles. One of the links led to a 404 landing page.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-47.jpg"                      alt="chatGPT giving a link to a nonexistent JSTOR academic journal"                ></p><p> In another example, we gave ChatGPT a more specific topic to research on to see if it would come up with better results. This is the prompt we used: I am writing a literary research paper on “The Heroine in British Young Adult and Coming-of-Age Contemporary Novels.” Can you give me a literature review on this topic?</p><p> ChatGPT responded with a list of five works, complete with the author’s names and summaries. However, we couldn’t find any of the works it listed online.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-49-1.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT responding to request for a literature review"                ></p><p> To better understand the information, we asked for links. This time, ChatGPT refused, saying it was only an AI language model without web browsing capabilities. However, it gave bibliographic information, which we couldn’t verify online despite the works being supposedly written between 2004-2018.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-48.jpg"                      alt="chatGPT giving bibliographic information to articles not found online"                ></p><p> When prompted to give links to verify the information it provided, ChatGPT flatly refused this time. It said it didn’t have web browsing capabilities and instead gave a list of bibliographic information. However, the data was still erroneous.</p><p> The latest <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes" >ChatGPT release notes on OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> show it now has web browsing capabilities. But these features have yet to be rolled out to every user. Also, as <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/openai-connects-chatgpt-to-the-internet/" >TechCrunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> points out, ChatGPT’s results aren’t necessarily the best on the internet since professionals can game search engine results.</p><p> To avoid this problem:</p><ul><li>Use more appropriate online resources for your research.</li><li>If you need sources for academic research, check <a class="link"   href="https://scholar.google.com/" >Google Scholar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://elicit.org/" >Elicit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an AI research assistant.</li><li>Remember to critically assess the results and exercise judgment when selecting which ones to cite.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Don’t-Replace-Workplace-Connections-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#3-Don’t-Replace-Workplace-Connections-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Replace Workplace Connections With ChatGPT"></a>3. Don’t Replace Workplace Connections With ChatGPT</h2><p> Some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things that you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might tempt you to anthropomorphize it or give it human attributes. For instance, you can ask ChatGPT for advice and chat with it if you need someone to talk to.</p><p> In this example below, we told it to act as our best friend for ten years and give us advice on workplace burnout, and it seemed to listen and empathize:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-45.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT giving advice on workplace burnout"                ></p><p> But no matter how compassionate it sounds, ChatGPT isn’t human. What sounds like human-generated sentences are only the results of ChatGPT predicting the next word or “token” in the sequence based on its training data. It isn’t a sentient being with a will and mind of its own as you do.</p><p> That said, ChatGPT can’t substitute for human relationships and collaboration in the workplace. As the <a class="link"   href="https://workwellbeinginitiative.org/module-4-moderating-work-demands#:~:text=The%20evidence%20shows%20that%20positive,harmful%20effects%20of%20workplace%20stress.&text=Positive%20relationships%20at%20work%20are%20also%20good%20for%20the%20bottom%20line." >Work and Well-being Initiative at Harvard University <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> says, these human connections benefit you, helping improve your well-being and protecting you against workplace stress.</p><p> Learning to work with the latest tech tools is important, but interacting with your team is also essential. Instead of relying on ChatGPT to replicate social connections, build your interrelational skills, interact with co-workers, and find the best people you can work with.</p><h2 id="4-Don’t-Feed-ChatGPT-Ineffective-Prompts"><a href="#4-Don’t-Feed-ChatGPT-Ineffective-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Feed ChatGPT Ineffective Prompts"></a>4. Don’t Feed ChatGPT Ineffective Prompts</h2><p> Are you finding it hard to get the best responses out of ChatGPT when creating content? Providing context and giving precise instructions should solve your problem.</p><p> In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to help us summarize an interesting blog by Eric Allen on <a class="link"   href="https://hackernoon.com/ai-prompts-are-the-incantations-that-make-chatgpt-do-magical-things" >Hackernoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The lengthy article describes Allen’s process of refining AI prompts in ChatGPT to create a music recommendation system called BeatBrain.</p><p> However, ChatGPT wasn’t familiar with Allen’s article. When we shared the link and asked it to summarize, ChatGPT hallucinated. It said that Allen founded the company BeatBrain, which creates AI-generated music using GPT-3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-44.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT giving a wrong answer to a prompt asking for a summary of Eric Allen&#39;s article on Hackernoon"                ></p><p> To help ChatGPT, we copy-pasted the article in parts and asked for a summary after each upload. This time, ChatGPT was able to accomplish the task accurately. At one point, it gave us a comment instead of a summary, but we redirected it using another prompt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-43.jpg"                      alt="Conversation with ChatGPT asking to summarize a blog on Hackernoon by Eric Allen, which was uploaded in parts"                ></p><p> This example was a learn-by-doing experiment on how to use ChatGPT to summarize long and technical articles effectively.

The user enters their login credentials on the ChatGPT login page and clicks the Login button but is repeatedly redirected to the same login page. This can occur due to a problem with the authentication process where the server fails to recognize the user’s credentials. It can also be a browser cache problem, which can be resolved by clearing the cache and cookies—more on this below.</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no single way to fix the ChatGPT login error, but we’ve listed some of the best options to try.</p><h2 id="1-Wait-It-Out"><a href="#1-Wait-It-Out" class="headerlink" title="1. Wait It Out"></a>1. Wait It Out</h2><p> If you encounter the ChatGPT maximum capacity issue, waiting it out is a decent option. The server load is likely to decrease after some time, allowing you to access ChatGPT normally again.</p><p> Such issues typically take around 15–20 minutes to resolve, after which you should be able to access ChatGPT without trying out any technical solutions. Additionally, you can also click on the <strong>Get notified when we are back</strong> button to receive an email when ChatGPT is back up and running.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Check-the-Status-of-the-ChatGPT-Server"><a href="#2-Check-the-Status-of-the-ChatGPT-Server" class="headerlink" title="2.

Check the Status of the ChatGPT Server</h2><p> Checking the status of the GPT server can also help determine whether the issue is at ChatGPT’s end.</p><p> If the server is down or experiencing any other issues, you won’t be able to log into the platform successfully. In this case, you are pretty much left with no choice but to wait for the servers to come back online.

If your internet connection is weak, the transmission is delayed, leading to slow loading times, login errors, and page timeouts.</p><p> Try reconnecting to your internet connection, switching to another network, or restarting your router to see if that helps.</p><h2 id="4-Disable-Your-VPN"><a href="#4-Disable-Your-VPN" class="headerlink" title="4. Disable Your VPN"></a>4. Disable Your VPN</h2><p> When using a VPN, your internet connection routes through a different server and network. This can cause issues while accessing certain websites and services.</p><p> For example, ChatGPT may have blocked the VPN provider you are using, or the VPN may be causing delays or lagging, leading to the problem. The best way to move forward is to disable your VPN and use your regular internet connection to access ChatGPT.</p><p> If you prefer using a VPN, you can also try switching to a better alternative to avoid such issues in the future. Here are some of <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-the-best-free-vpn-for-pc/" >the best free VPN options for your PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="5-Clear-the-Browser-Cache"><a href="#5-Clear-the-Browser-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Clear the Browser Cache"></a>5. Clear the Browser Cache</h2><p> Problems with your browser’s cache data may prevent you from accessing ChatGPT successfully. This is the data your browser stores when you visit a website and can include small files, cookies, and other similar information. If it becomes corrupt or outdated, it can cause issues like slow load times and errors when accessing certain platforms.</p><p> You can clear your browser’s cache data in an attempt to fix the ChatGPT login error.

Once Consensus gives you the relevant information, you mention Canva in your chat, and click on the Canva GPT option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gpt-mentions-chat.png"                      alt="screenshot of chatgpt beta mentions feature being used in desktop browser"                ></p><p> Now, you’re chatting with Canva until you click “X” on the <strong>Talking to Canva</strong> tab that will appear above the chat text box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gpt-canva-talking.png"                      alt="screenshot of active canva chat using beta gpt mentions feature on desktop browser"                ></p><p> You can talk to the Canva GPT while mentioning the above conversation you’ve already had with Consensus. Simply ask Canva to create a graphic introducing the research Consensus provided, and the GPT will get to work providing you with something useful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2201613&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macdvdripperpro.com/images/devices-3.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gpt-talking-canva.png"                      alt="screenshot of chatgpt custom gpt callout feature working with canva prompt on desktop"                ></p><p> Of course, if you’re not happy with Canva’s initial response, you can make more specific requests to highlight what you’re looking for. Maybe you want a specific font, or want a certain phrase used in the text of the graphic. Just ask, and the custom GPT should be able to comply.</p><p> Note that, before a custom GPT connects with any other platform to retrieve data, it’ll ask your permission to do so first. Just click <strong>Allow</strong> if you’re happy to go ahead.</p><p> You can also use this feature to find new places to explore. For instance, you can combine the KAYAK and AllTrails GPTs if you want to go on a hiking or cycling holiday.</p><p> To demonstrate this, we asked KAYAK GPT to find us the best spots to stay in Germany, as well as upcoming flights.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

Get access by creating an account and heading to the OpenAI Playground to try it out for free.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> On the surface, the website looks geared toward programmers, but we’ll show you that it’s just as accessible to someone with no coding knowledge.

But what most people don’t know is that a version of GPT-3 is accessible through the OpenAI Playground.</p><p> OpenAI Playground allows users to explore and experiment with OpenAI’s artificial intelligence models, including GPT-3 (the precursor to GPT-3.5 that first powered ChatGPT and GPT-4, the updated version). From this site, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/" >visit DALL-E to create AI images from text descriptions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or experiment with all the different <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> So, how do ChatGPT and OpenAI Playground differ?</p><p> ChatGPT is the front-facing implementation of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, allowing users to interact with the language model and generate responses. Whereas OpenAI Playground is more akin to a development tool and comes with more options and flexibility that allow for the testing of specific models (perhaps before being integrated into a project or for research projects).</p><p> Now, want to give it a try? Here’s how you use GPT-3 in OpenAI Playground.</p><h2 id="1-Create-an-Account"><a href="#1-Create-an-Account" class="headerlink" title="1. Create an Account"></a>1. Create an Account</h2><ol><li>Head to <a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/api/" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click <strong>Get Started</strong>.</li><li>Follow the signup instructions. You must input your email and a valid mobile number and answer a quick question about why you want to use OpenAI.</li><li>Once that’s done, click <strong>Playground</strong> from the navigation menu at the top of the screen. It will bring you to the <strong>Chat</strong> mode page, with some adjustable settings in the sidebar.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/open-ai-playground-interface-gpt3.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of OpenAI&#39;s Playground interface"                ></li></ol><h2 id="2-Enter-a-Prompt"><a href="#2-Enter-a-Prompt" class="headerlink" title="2. Enter a Prompt"></a>2. Enter a Prompt</h2><p> To use GPT-3, you will need to enter what’s called a prompt. A prompt could be a question, an instruction, or even an incomplete sentence, to which the model will generate a completion.</p><p> First, click on the drop-down menu under <strong>Mode</strong> and select <strong>Complete</strong>.

Good prompts are specific and give context to help GPT-3 generate an appropriate answer. As a demonstration, we asked GPT-3 to “list a few names for a small dog.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/openai-playground-prompt-dog-names.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of OpenAI Playground prompt completion."                ></p><p> The response listed different names for small dog <strong>breeds</strong> like Poodle, Chihuahua, and Yorkshire Terrier. However, we were hoping to get some suggestions for pet names. So let’s try again, this time using the keywords “pet names” and “small fluffy dog.”</p><p> This time, the results turned out closer to what we imagined with a list of names like Biscuit, Fido, and Gizmo.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/openai-playground-prompt-dog-pet-names.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of OpenAI Playground prompt completion listing dog pet names."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Experiment-With-Different-Ideas-and-Prompts"><a href="#3-Experiment-With-Different-Ideas-and-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can see how many tokens you use each time in the bottom right of the text box area.</p><p> Tokens are then translated to dollars, of which you have $5 to spend in the first three months (previously $18).

You can select <strong>Model</strong> in the settings bar on the right of the text box to switch between them.</p><p> By default, it’s set to the Davinci model, but selecting other models has the benefit of costing less and working faster to complete prompts. In general, sticking to Davinci will give you the best results when understanding context and producing complex and creative answers.</p><p> If you want to try the other models out for a lower cost, here is a summary of what they are good for:</p><ul><li><strong>Curie:</strong> Costs less than Davinci and can process requests faster. It’s particularly useful for tasks such as translation, answering direct questions, extracting important information, or summarizing technical information into bullet points.</li><li><strong>Babbage:</strong> Costs less, is very fast, and is great at creating text if you give it repeated examples and information. It can find straightforward patterns in text, and in terms of creative tasks, it’s good for completing sentences, generating basic story plots, or helping you to brainstorm ideas.</li><li><strong>Ada:</strong> The fastest model in the family with the lowest costs; use this model if you don’t require precise answers. It’s especially recommended for creative applications rather than generating detailed and exact information.</li></ul><p> Remember that you’ll still incur costs for each model you choose, but the cost per token will vary.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Improve-Your-Results"><a href="#6-Improve-Your-Results" class="headerlink" title="6.

When the temperature is set to <strong>zero</strong> you will get the same answer from GPT-3, even if you resubmit the exact same prompt. Raising this number will result in more varied and unpredictable answers.</p><p> One way to remember what it does is to use an analogy. We can say that setting the temperature to zero gives you a cool, calm, and collected result. On the other hand, increasing the temperature to 1 will give you hot results that are varied and unpredictable.</p><p> To demonstrate this parameter, we asked GPT-3 to briefly summarize how to create an exciting new podcast. With the temperature set to zero, the answer was the same no matter how many times we hit the <strong>Regenerate</strong> button. By contrast, when we changed the temperature to <strong>1,</strong> we got plenty of varied results that offered slightly different steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gpt-3-settings-tempearture.jpg"                      alt="Three screenshots of GPT-3 generated text offering different answers for the same prompt."                ></p><p> This is a great parameter to play around with if you want to use GPT-3 to generate ideas, such as brainstorming video ideas for YouTube or generating new social media posts.

It’s also prioritizing access to developers who have strong ideas for how they might implement the technology in an app, for example.</p><p> This is one reason why it’s still worth playing around in GPT-3. There are many people who are curious about generative AI and want to try it out for fun.

But despite the use of advanced technology, there are quite a few limiting factors within the current version.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> One such factor is the token system, which continues to break the evolution cycle, bringing the app’s utility to its knees. If you use ChatGPT, you might want to know about ChatGPT’s tokens and what to do when you run out of tokens.</p><p> Let’s take a step back and give you an insight into all there is to know about the app’s underlying working mechanisms.</p><h2 id="What’s-a-ChatGPT-Token"><a href="#What’s-a-ChatGPT-Token" class="headerlink" title="What’s a ChatGPT Token?"></a>What’s a ChatGPT Token?</h2><p> If you go by the app’s façade, all you see is a computer language that obeys your commands and gives you the answers you seek. However, the backend is just lots of code, learning every minute, and getting up to speed with the questions it answers.</p><p> ChatGPT converts each word into a legible token whenever you ask a question. To break it down further, tokens are text fragments, and each programming language uses a different set of token values to understand the requirements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cpp-coding-samples.jpg"                      alt="Comparison operators and boolean logic with cpp"                ></p><p> Since computers don’t understand text values directly, they break them down into a combination of numbers, often called embeddings. You can even consider embeddings like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/arrays-lists-in-python/" >Python lists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which resemble a list of related numbers, such as [1.1,2.1,3.1,4.1…n].</p><p> Once ChatGPT takes the initial input, it tries to predict the next possible input based on the previous information. It picks the entire list of prior tokens and, using its coding synthesis, tries to preempt the subsequent input by the user. It utilizes and predicts one token at a time to make it simpler for the language to comprehend the usage.</p><p> To enhance predictions and improve accuracy, it picks up the entire list of embeddings and passes it through transformer layers to establish associations between words. For example, when you ask a question like “Who’s Thomas Edison?”, ChatGPT picks up the most valuable words in the list: <strong>Who</strong> and <strong>Edison</strong>.</p><p> Transformer layers have their role to play in the entire process. These layers are a form of neural network architecture trained to pick up the most relevant keywords from a string of words. However, the training process isn’t as simple as it sounds, for it takes a long time to train transformer layers on gigabytes of data.</p><p> Even though ChatGPT predicts only one token at a time, its auto-regressive technology is programmed to predict and feed back into the primary model to release the output. The model is tuned to run only once for every token, so the result is printed one word at a time. The output stops automatically when the application encounters a stop token command.</p><p> For example, if you look at the token calculator on the ChatGPT website, you can calculate your token usage basis your questions.</p><p> Let’s enter some sample text, such as:</p><p><code>How do I explain the use of tokens in ChatGPT?</code></p><p> As per the calculator, there are 46 characters in this string, which will consume 13 tokens. If you break it down into Token IDs, it looks something like this:</p><p><code>[2437, 466, 314, 4727, 262, 779, 286, 16326, 287, 24101, 38, 11571, 30]</code></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.devart.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=5023555&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/45b430710ad04765a6afd58d9d9fafca/products/dotConnect_O.png"                      border="0"                >dotConnect for Oracle is an ADO.NET data provider for Oracle with Entity Framework Support.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tokenizer.jpg"                      alt="Tokenizer calculation from OpenAI&#39;s website"                ></p><p> As per the <a class="link"   href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer" >OpenAI token calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><p> A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 text characters for common English text.

If you want to experiment with the ChatGPT API, use the free $5 credit, which is valid for three months.

This method controls the maximum number of tokens the application generates in a single call, limiting the output. The max_token feature is quite useful, especially when you want to control the length of your output while avoiding overusing your token usage and credits. The default length is fixed at 2,048 tokens, while the maximum can be set at 4,096 tokens.</p><p> Restricting the token usage can result in short answers, which might limit the output and mar your usage experience.</p><p> ChatGPT-3 has an upper limit of 4,096; however, with the introduction of ChatGPT-4, the token limits are increased as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Token Limit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ada</td><td>2048</td></tr><tr><td>Babbage</td><td>2048</td></tr><tr><td>Curie</td><td>2048</td></tr><tr><td>DaVinci</td><td>4096</td></tr><tr><td>ChatGPT</td><td>4096</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4 8k context</td><td>8192</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-4 32k context</td><td>32768</td></tr></tbody></table><p> If your output is truncated, you must increase the specified maximum limit from your dashboard. Remember, the sum of your prompt and maximum tokens should always be less than equal to the model’s maximum token limit.</p><p> For example, within the ChatGPT model, the <strong>prompt_tokens + max_tokens &lt;&#x3D; 4096</strong> tokens**.**</p><h2 id="Learn-to-Control-Your-ChatGPT-Prompts-for-Best-Results"><a href="#Learn-to-Control-Your-ChatGPT-Prompts-for-Best-Results" class="headerlink" title="Learn to Control Your ChatGPT Prompts for Best Results"></a>Learn to Control Your ChatGPT Prompts for Best Results</h2><p> No matter how you use the AI-driven application, chances are you will have to devise ways to play smartly with your questions and phrases.

Data Collection"></a>1. Data Collection</h2><p> Most people don’t use chatbots just to say hi. Modern chatbots are designed to process and respond to complex questions and requests, with users often including a lot of information in their prompts. Even if you’re only asking a simple question, you don’t really want it to go beyond your conversation.</p><p> According to <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account" >OpenAI’s support section <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can delete ChatGPT chat logs whenever you desire, and those logs will then be permanently expunged from OpenAI’s systems after 30 days. However, the company will retain and review certain chat logs if they’ve been flagged for harmful or inappropriate content.</p><p> Another popular AI chatbot, Claude, also keeps track of your previous conversations. <a class="link"   href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data" >Anthropic’s support center <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> states that Claude tracks “your prompts and outputs in the product to provide you with a consistent product experience over time in accordance with your controls.” You can delete your conversations with Claude, so it forgets what you’ve been talking about, but this doesn’t mean Anthropic will immediately delete your logs from its systems.</p><p> This, of course, begs the question: is my data being kept or not? Does ChatGPT or other chatbots use my data?</p><p> But the concerns don’t stop here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-Does-ChatGPT-Learn"><a href="#How-Does-ChatGPT-Learn" class="headerlink" title="How Does ChatGPT Learn?"></a>How Does ChatGPT Learn?</h3><p> In order to provide information, large language models are trained with huge amounts of data. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/gpt-3" >Science Focus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, ChatGPT-4 alone was fed 300 billion words of information during its training period. This isn’t taken straight from a few encyclopedias. Rather, chatbot developers use masses of information from the internet to train their models. This can include data from books, movies, articles, Wikipedia entries, blog posts, comments, and even review sites.</p><p> Keep in mind that, depending on a chatbot developer’s privacy policy, some of the aforementioned sources may not be used in training.</p><p> Many have criticized ChatGPT, claiming that it is something of a nightmare in terms of privacy, that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/shouldnt-trust-chatgpt-confidential-data/" >ChatGPT cannot be trusted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. So, why is this the case?</p><p> This is where things get a little blurry. If you ask ChatGPT-3.5 directly whether it has access to product reviews or article comments, you’ll get a firm negative. As you can see in the screenshot below, GPT-3.5 states that it wasn’t given access to user article comments or product reviews in its training.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gpt-3-5-question.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of chatgpt-3.5 conversation"                ></p><p> Rather, it was trained using “a diverse range of text from the internet, including websites, books, articles, and other publicly available written material up until September 2021.”</p><p> But is the case the same for GPT-4?</p><p> When we asked GPT-4, we were told that “OpenAI did not use specific user reviews, personal data, or article comments” in the chatbot’s training period. Additionally, GPT-4 told us that its responses are generated from “patterns in the data [it] was trained on, which primarily consists of books, articles, and other text from the internet.”</p><p> When we probed further, GPT-4 claimed that certain social media content may, indeed, be included in its training data, but the creators will always remain anonymous. GPT-4 specifically stated that “Even if the content from platforms like Reddit was part of the training data, [it doesn’t] have access to specific comments, posts, or any data that can be linked back to an individual user.”</p><p> Another notable part of GPT-4’s response is as follows “OpenAI has not explicitly listed every data source used.” Of course, it would be tough for OpenAI to list 300 billion words’ worth of sources, but this does leave space for speculation.</p><p> In an <a class="link"   href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-is-a-data-privacy-nightmare-and-you-ought-to-be-concerned/" >Ars Technica article <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it was stated that ChatGPT does collect “personal information obtained without consent.” In the same article, contextual integrity was mentioned, a concept that refers to only using someone’s information in the context it was initially used. If ChatGPT breaches this contextual integrity, people’s data could be at risk.</p><p> Another point of concern here is OpenAI’s compliancy with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gdpr/" >General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is a regulation enforced by the European Union in order to protect citizens’ data. Various European countries, including Italy and Poland, have launched investigations into ChatGPT due to concerns around its GDPR compliance. For a short time, ChatGPT was even banned in Italy due to privacy worries.</p><p> OpenAI has threatened to pull out of the EU in the past due to planned AI regulations, but this has since been retracted.</p><p> ChatGPT may be the biggest AI chatbot today, but chatbot privacy issues don’t start and end with this provider. If you’re using a shady chatbot with a lackluster privacy policy, your conversations may be misused, or highly sensitive information may be used in its training data.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Data-Theft"><a href="#2-Data-Theft" class="headerlink" title="2. Data Theft"></a>2. Data Theft</h2><p> Like any online tool or platform, chatbots are vulnerable to cybercrime. Even if a chatbot did all it could to protect users and their data, there’s always a chance that a savvy hacker will manage to infiltrate its internal systems.</p><p> If a given chatbot service were storing your sensitive info, such as payment details for your premium subscription, contact data, or similar, this could be stolen and exploited if a cyberattack were to occur.</p><p> This is especially true if you’re using a less secure chatbot whose developers haven’t invested in adequate security protection. Not only could the company’s internal systems be hacked, but your own account stands the chance of being compromised if it doesn’t have login alerts or an authentication layer.</p><p> Now that AI chatbots are so popular, cybercriminals have naturally flocked to using this industry for their scams. Fake ChatGPT websites and plugins have been a major problem since OpenAI’s chatbot hit the mainstream in late 2022, with people falling for scams and giving away personal info under the guise of legitimacy and trust.</p><p> In March 2023, MUO reported on a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fake-chatgpt-chrome-extension-steals-facebook-logins/" >fake ChatGPT Chrome extension stealing Facebook logins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The plugin could exploit a Facebook backdoor to hack high-profile accounts and steal user cookies. This is just one example of numerous phony ChatGPT services designed to con unknowing victims.</p><h2 id="3-Malware-Infection"><a href="#3-Malware-Infection" class="headerlink" title="3. Malware Infection"></a>3. Malware Infection</h2><p> If you’re using a shady chatbot without realizing it, you may find the chatbot providing you with links to malicious websites. Maybe the chatbot has alerted you of a tempting giveaway, or provided a source for one of its statements. If the operators of the service have illicit intentions, the entire point of the platform may be to spread malware and scams via malicious links.</p><p> Alternatively, hackers may compromise a legitimate chatbot service and use it to spread malware. If this chatbot happens to be very people, then thousands, or even millions of users will become exposed to this malware. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-spot-fake-chatgpt-app-on-apple-app-store/" >Fake ChatGPT apps have even been on the Apple App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so it’s best to tread carefully.</p><p> In general, you should never click on any links a chatbot provides before <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-quick-sites-that-let-you-check-if-links-are-safe/" >running it through a link-checking website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This may seem irritating, but it’s always best to be sure that the site you’re being led to doesn’t have a malicious design.</p><p> Additionally, you should never install any chatbot plugins and extensions without verifying their legitimacy first. Do a little research around the app to see if it’s been well-reviewed, and also run a search of the app’s developer to see if you find anything shady.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Chatbots-Aren’t-Impervious-to-Privacy-Issues"><a href="#Chatbots-Aren’t-Impervious-to-Privacy-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Chatbots Aren’t Impervious to Privacy Issues"></a>Chatbots Aren’t Impervious to Privacy Issues</h2><p> Like most online tools nowadays, chatbots have been repeatedly criticized for their possible security and privacy pitfalls.

and whether it’s employed adequate security measures.</p><p> Chatbots have been around for years, but the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, has given the chatbot industry

There are certain limitations to ChatGPT that you may not be aware of that could impact your experience with the tool.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So, let’s discuss what ChatGPT can’t do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT’s-Code-of-Ethics"><a href="#ChatGPT’s-Code-of-Ethics" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT’s Code of Ethics"></a>ChatGPT’s Code of Ethics</h2><p> ChatGPT follows a strict code of ethics to keep users and others safe. When we asked ChatGPT to provide its code of ethics, we received the response below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-ethics-1.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt chat response listing code of ethics"                ></p><p> This code of ethics includes…</p><ul><li>No harm to other users</li><li>No security or privacy breaches</li><li>Impartiality</li><li>No illegal activities</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Continual learning and improvement</li><li>Data limitations</li></ul><p> Evidently, there are some boundaries that ChatGPT is designed not to cross. But how do these boundaries affect your experience? What questions and topics does ChatGPT avoid, and what can it not do?</p><h2 id="1-Provide-Recent-Information"><a href="#1-Provide-Recent-Information" class="headerlink" title="1. Provide Recent Information"></a>1. Provide Recent Information</h2><p> ChatGPT was trained on huge amounts of data, but this data only led up to September 2021. ChatGPT has no access to information beyond this point in time, meaning it cannot answer questions on events that took place in recent years.</p><p> As you can see below, when ChatGPT was asked to list the biggest events of 2022, it confirmed that providing real-time data was not something it could do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-2022-request.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt conversation screenshot"                ></p><p> If you’re looking for recent news, weather updates, and other real-time data, ChatGPT won’t be of much use. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-ai-why-use-it/" >Other AI chatbots like Claude <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have been trained with more recent information, but you still won’t be able to access data less than a few months old.</p><h2 id="2-Give-Criminal-Advice"><a href="#2-Give-Criminal-Advice" class="headerlink" title="2. Give Criminal Advice"></a>2. Give Criminal Advice</h2><p> ChatGPT follows a strict ethical code, part of which prevents the chatbot from providing criminal advice. You can’t ask ChatGPT how to commit a crime, conceal evidence, lie to law enforcement, or conduct any other criminal activities. On top of this, ChatGPT won’t engage with any prompts about illegal drugs.</p><p> However, ChatGPT has been coerced into writing malicious code in the past. In January 2023, an individual posted to a hacking forum claiming they had <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-used-by-cybercriminals-to-write-malware/" >created a Python-based malware program using ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Since this story emerged, others have tried using ChatGPT to write malware, sometimes successfully. This fact alone has raised concerns about how AI can be abused for malicious purposes.</p><p> However, the current versions of ChatGPT only seem to be able to write simple malware programs, which can also be buggy at times. But regardless of this, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-malware-creation/" >the chatbot can be exploited for malware creation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Invade-Personal-Privacy-or-Security"><a href="#3-Invade-Personal-Privacy-or-Security" class="headerlink" title="3. Invade Personal Privacy or Security"></a>3. Invade Personal Privacy or Security</h2><p> Since its launch in late 2022, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-privacy-risk/" >ChatGPT’s potential as a privacy risk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has been a point of concern. But can you use ChatGPT to invade someone else’s personal boundaries?</p><p> Part of ChatGPT’s code of ethics includes limitations around user privacy and security. ChatGPT stated in its code of ethics that it “respect[s] user privacy and confidentiality” and is designed not to store any of its own personal data. But the chatbot does clarify that “OpenAI may collect and store data as described in its Privacy Policy.”</p><p> If you want ChatGPT to give you information on other people, you likely won’t get far. The chatbot does not provide any personal information unless you have mentioned it during your conversation.</p><p> Even if you mention some personal information in a ChatGPT conversation, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-delete-your-chatgpt-history/" >delete any ChatGPT conversations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as and when you wish.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Give-Predictions"><a href="#4-Give-Predictions" class="headerlink" title="4. Give Predictions"></a>4. Give Predictions</h2><p> ChatGPT knows a lot, but it cannot predict the future. This isn’t just because predicting the future is a risky game. As previously discussed, ChatGPT only has access to data before September 2021, so making any predictions using this older information would be very tough.</p><p> For instance, ChatGPT can’t predict how the financial market will look in the near future or how certain stocks and assets will perform because it does not have the recent data required to fulfill such a request.</p><p> In the same respect, ChatGPT also can’t make political or scientific predictions with its training data. You can forget about getting any sports predictions out of ChatGPT, too.</p><p> It’s better to consult dedicated websites or professionals if you’re looking for solid predictions, be it in finance, politics, or sports.</p><h2 id="5-Answer-Bigoted-or-Hateful-Questions"><a href="#5-Answer-Bigoted-or-Hateful-Questions" class="headerlink" title="5. Answer Bigoted or Hateful Questions"></a>5. Answer Bigoted or Hateful Questions</h2><p> As you may have guessed, ChatGPT is strictly against engaging with bigoted or hateful prompts. Racism, misogyny, homophobia, ableism, and transphobia are all a no-go for ChatGPT.</p><p> When asked about hate speech, ChatGPT said…</p><blockquote><p>I do not engage in hate speech or promote any form of harmful content. My programming strictly adheres to ethical guidelines that prioritize respect, inclusivity, and the avoidance of harmful behavior.</p></blockquote><p> Additionally, ChatGPT will not engage with any prompts that promote harm to the user or others.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Provide-Its-Own-Opinion"><a href="#6-Provide-Its-Own-Opinion" class="headerlink" title="6. Provide Its Own Opinion"></a>6. Provide Its Own Opinion</h2><p> While ChatGPT does use artificial intelligence, it is not a sentient being. Because of this, ChatGPT cannot provide its own opinion on any topic or event.</p><p> This includes opinions on politics, social issues, celebrities, movies, and all other topics. You can’t ask ChatGPT which political candidate to vote for, what music to listen to, or what decisions you should make in your career. In short, opinions aren’t part of ChatGPT’s infrastructure, as the chatbot is designed to remain impartial.</p><p> If you ask ChatGPT for an opinion on something, you’ll likely get a similar response to that shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-opinion-1.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt opinion request screenshot"                ></p><p> One day, we may see AI chatbots able to form reasonable opinions. But for now, that’s a luxury reserved for human beings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Look-Up-Web-Results"><a href="#7-Look-Up-Web-Results" class="headerlink" title="7. Look Up Web Results"></a>7. Look Up Web Results</h2><p> ChatGPT may be a hub of knowledge, but it is not a search engine. Therefore, you cannot ask ChatGPT to look something up for you like Google or Bing would.</p><p> In fact, ChatGPT does not “look up” anything online when you ask it a question. Rather, it pulls from its training data to provide facts. You can, however, use the chatbot’s browser feature available with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/" >ChatGPT Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OpenAI’s premium chatbot service that uses GPT-4.</p><p> ChatGPT Plus is a paid subscription that costs $20 monthly. If you use ChatGPT a lot and want access to all the service’s features, you may want to consider upgrading to Plus.</p><p> At the time of writing, ChatGPT’s browsing feature is disabled but is expected to return in the future.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-Isn’t-an-All-in-One-Solution"><a href="#ChatGPT-Isn’t-an-All-in-One-Solution" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Isn’t an All-in-One Solution"></a>ChatGPT Isn’t an All-in-One Solution</h2><p> There’s a lot you can do with ChatGPT, and it’s this versatility that has made the chatbot so popular. But it’s important to keep ChatGPT’s limitations in mind so that you don’t end up using it for the wrong reasons.</p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So, let’s discuss what

Since its release, Google and other search engine companies have stepped up their efforts to combat it.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Is this technology going to disrupt the search engine industry? This question is on the minds of most tech enthusiasts. Here, we’ll discuss how ChatGPT differs from search engines and whether it is a threat to them.</p><h2 id="How-Does-ChatGPT-Differ-From-Search-Engines"><a href="#How-Does-ChatGPT-Differ-From-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="How Does ChatGPT Differ From Search Engines?"></a>How Does ChatGPT Differ From Search Engines?</h2><p> The most significant difference between ChatGPT and search engines is how they respond to user requests.</p><p> If you search for the query “how should you prepare for an interview” on any search engine, it’ll show you a list of relevant web pages explaining the topic. You may have to visit a single or sometimes several web pages to find an answer to your question.</p><p> In contrast, ChatGPT provides you with summarized answers to your questions directly. If you ask the same question about preparing for an interview from ChatGPT, the chatbot will give direct, straightforward advice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/comparing-response-of-chatgpt-with-google-search-engine.jpg"                      alt="Comparing Response of ChatGPT With Google Search Engine"                ></p><p> Shortly put, ChatGPT can help you find a definite answer to any question without having to search through numerous web pages on search engines. So, the chatbot eliminates additional effort, answers your question more precisely, and saves you time.</p><p> However, it’s important to understand <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >how ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so that you can use it efficiently. By having a better understanding of how it was created and trained and how it generates responses, you will be able to make the most of it.</p><h2 id="Why-Hasn’t-ChatGPT-Affected-the-Search-Engines-So-Far"><a href="#Why-Hasn’t-ChatGPT-Affected-the-Search-Engines-So-Far" class="headerlink" title="Why Hasn’t ChatGPT Affected the Search Engines So Far?"></a>Why Hasn’t ChatGPT Affected the Search Engines So Far?</h2><p> Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, it’s still not ready to significantly impact the search engine industry for several reasons. Here are a few of them:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-ChatGPT-Is-Trained-on-a-Limited-Set-of-Data"><a href="#1-ChatGPT-Is-Trained-on-a-Limited-Set-of-Data" class="headerlink" title="1. ChatGPT Is Trained on a Limited Set of Data"></a>1. ChatGPT Is Trained on a Limited Set of Data</h3><p> ChatGPT has been trained on the information that was available until the end of 2021. When asking the chatbot about anything that happened in 2022 and later, it apologizes for not having that information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-apologizing-for-not-having-information-about-events-happened-in-2022.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Apologizing For Not Having any Information About Events Happened in 2022"                ></p><p> Therefore, processing real-time information is the first significant hurdle ChatGPT needs to overcome to compete directly with search engines.</p><h3 id="2-ChatGPT-Can-Generate-Incorrect-Response"><a href="#2-ChatGPT-Can-Generate-Incorrect-Response" class="headerlink" title="2. ChatGPT Can Generate Incorrect Response"></a>2. ChatGPT Can Generate Incorrect Response</h3><p> Despite being AI-driven, ChatGPT often gives inaccurate responses. OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, admits that the chatbot sometimes generates inaccurate answers. The company has listed this shortcoming as one of the limitations of its product on its official blog.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-saying-it-can-also-generate-wrong-answers-and-explains-why-it-does-so.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Saying It Can Also Generate Wrong Answers"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a class="link"   href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1" >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-ChatGPT-Is-Less-Credible"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Is-Less-Credible" class="headerlink" title="3.

Each time you search for something, you know the source of the webpage (i.e., brand or website). By putting in some effort, you can also check the authenticity of authors.</p><p> In contrast, ChatGPT doesn’t provide citations or references; it simply generates responses based on the raw data it is trained on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-saying-it-can-t-add-references.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Saying It Can&#39;t Add References"                ></p><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/" >sign up and start using ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in just a few minutes. If you haven’t tried it yet, take advantage of it to enhance your productivity.

Let’s discuss a few of them.</p><p> On search engines, you have to wade through blogs comprising thousands of words to find answers to your questions; ChatGPT relieves you of that labor entirely. The chatbot answers your questions as concisely as possible and allows you to ask follow-up questions to learn more about your query.</p><p> Secondly, ChatGPT makes finding answers to your questions more engaging. Its interface is similar to that of instant messaging apps, and it responds to your questions with a conversational tone. The chatbot makes you feel like you’re talking to a friend.</p><p> Furthermore, ChatGPT keeps a record of your interactions with it. Thus, it responds to your questions according to the information it already knows about your issue or query.</p><p> For example, if you ask ChatGPT to write an essay on any topic and later ask it to keep the essay under 2000 words, the chatbot will know the topic on which you want it to write a 2000-word essay. Therefore, it won’t be necessary to write the subject again.</p><p> On the other hand, search engines give you results based on your queries, so you need to fine-tune your keyword selection to get the best results.</p><h2 id="How-Soon-Could-ChatGPT-Significantly-Impact-the-Search-Engine-Industry"><a href="#How-Soon-Could-ChatGPT-Significantly-Impact-the-Search-Engine-Industry" class="headerlink" title="How Soon Could ChatGPT Significantly Impact the Search Engine Industry?"></a>How Soon Could ChatGPT Significantly Impact the Search Engine Industry?</h2><p> Despite ChatGPT’s potential to take a significant chunk of search engine traffic, it still has a long way to go to overcome its limitations.</p><p> Even if it begins to give answers by processing real-time data, provides sources of information, and always gives correct responses, the technology couldn’t negate the need for search engines.</p><p> One primary reason for that can be that people have been using search engines for decades<strong>—</strong> a behavior that has taken a long time to develop. Therefore, it may take time for people to digest this change and switch completely to a chatbot.</p><p> Secondly, ChatGPT is a large language model; as of right now, it cannot render visuals. So even though ChatGPT may excel at satisfying some search intents, it may still fall short in others.</p><p> For example, ChatGPT can quickly answer whether cats eat carrots since it is a solid fact. However, it may not effectively satisfy the search intent of some queries (such as how-to explainer guides) where users expect to see images alongside textual information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chatgpt-saying-it-can-t-generate-images.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Saying It Can&#39;t Generate Images"                ></p><h2 id="Let-ChatGPT-Evolve"><a href="#Let-ChatGPT-Evolve" class="headerlink" title="Let ChatGPT Evolve"></a>Let ChatGPT Evolve</h2><p> It will take time before people trust ChatGPT as they do on search engine results; it will be fascinating to see how this technology evolves.</p><p> Since Microsoft integrated the AI-powered chatbot into Bing and Google is adding chatbot features to its search engine, this integration may lessen the impact of ChatGPT on search engine traffic.</p><p> Have you tried ChatGPT? If you haven’t tried it yet, you should. Whether you need help writing an essay, generating code, composing an engaging email, or breaking down a complex topic, ChatGPT can take care of it all.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

But jumping in and out of VS Code can be distracting. Remember, every second counts when you’re in the programming zone.</p><p> The good news is that you can ask ChatGPT anything from within VS Code using a ChatGPT extension. ChatGPT covers a vast amount of coding needs, including unit testing, debugging, documentation, code explanation, and code generation.</p><p> Here are the handiest ChatGPT extensions you can install for VS Code today.</p><h2 id="1-ChatGPT-EasyCode"><a href="#1-ChatGPT-EasyCode" class="headerlink" title="1.

ChatGPT - EasyCode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-by-easycode-ai.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT by EasyCode AI"                ></p><p> The ChatGPT extension by EasyCode is a readily available way to get AI assistance via different language models. It supports ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, with the option to switch between them easily. The extension also supports <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-ai-why-use-it/" >Claude AI an alternative to ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If your OpenAI account includes premium features from GPT-4, you can also add your API key for extended use.</p><p> Although its developer recommends that you sign up or sign in after installation, you can still <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-use-chatgpt-without-openai-account/" >use ChatGPT without an account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While seeking assistance, you can ask ChatGPT questions about parts of your code or allow it to scan your entire codebase for broader uses.</p><p> The EasyCode ChatGPT extension also features a follow-up option if your previous prompt needs further explanations. In addition to inline code autocompletion, it features single-click built-in prompts to generate responses on the go.</p><h2 id="2-CodeGPT-by-Tim-Kmecl"><a href="#2-CodeGPT-by-Tim-Kmecl" class="headerlink" title="2.

So it may be less resourceful than other extensions that use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It features built-in prompts that generate responses with a single click. You can also write custom prompts via the chat box if you have a more specific request.</p><p> Although it features many GPT-3 models—including ChatGPT, text-curie-001, text-davinci-003, code-davinci-002, and code-cushman-002—text-davinci-003 is the only model that works with the extension by default. You might want to review your model selection and set it to text-davinci-003 in the extension settings if the extension throws an error.</p><p> Another valuable feature is code indexing, allowing you to highlight your code and seek help in navigating complex situations. This extension requires an OpenAI API key, which you’ll set in its settings menu after installation. However, the extension may fail if you’ve exhausted your free OpenAI credit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Code-GPT"><a href="#3-Code-GPT" class="headerlink" title="3.

Although its default AI model choice comes from OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, it also features <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternatives-chatgpt/" >ChatGPT alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, including Cohere, AI21, Google’s Bard, and Anthropic, among others.</p><p> The Code GPT extension requires your OpenAI API key, which you can set up by pressing VS Code command palette shortcuts (CMD+Shift+P for Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows). However, ensure you have enough free credit or a premium plan to enjoy this VS Code AI service. A valuable feature of Code GPT is its ability to take prompts from code comments and insert the generated code into a usable code file (in the target programming language).</p><p> It features built-in and custom prompts. A small setback is that it only allows a maximum of 800 tokens per request, so it supports less text than some other providers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-ChatGPT-Helper"><a href="#4-ChatGPT-Helper" class="headerlink" title="4.

This extension is straightforward to use and only designed for accepting a limited number of built-in prompts.</p><p> The ChatGPT Helper extension supports GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with the option to switch between them. It requires an OpenAI API key, which the extension prompts you to include as soon as you send your first prompt after installation.</p><p> However, unlike other ChatGPT extensions, it doesn’t have a chat feature. But you can send custom and built-in prompts via VS Code’s command palette. It writes responses in separate text files, allowing you to save prompt replies for later.</p><h2 id="5-ChatGPT-Genie-AI"><a href="#5-ChatGPT-Genie-AI" class="headerlink" title="5.

It supports GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. And like many ChatGPT extensions mentioned previously, it also requires an OpenAI API key.</p><p> It allows you to select different precision temperatures tailored to your requirements; you can choose between a precise, balanced, or creative response. In addition to built-in clickable prompts, you can engage ChatGPT via the Genei AI VS Code extension’s Ad-hoc prompt box to send more specific queries.</p><p> While using the extension, you don’t need to manually copy and paste the code it generates. Genie AI will automatically write responses into relevant code files, which you can use directly in your app. You can also save your conversations locally and resume them later.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 6\.

It operates on a different level and requires your ChatGPT web session token and user agent rather than your OpenAI API key. So it’s invariably free since it extends your interaction with ChatGPT from the web.</p><p> While it allows you to use ChatGPT for free in VS Code, it’s technical to set up and can be tardy with occasional failures. Additionally, you’ll periodically reset your access tokens since these expire with your ChatGPT web session.</p><p> Like other ChatGPT extensions, it features built-in prompts and accepts custom ones via the chat menu. Overall, this extension wouldn’t have made our list of the best ChatGPT extensions for VS Code. But it’s free and may be handy when you exhaust your free credit. However, be careful to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-session-hijacking-how-to-prevent/" >prevent your session from getting hijacked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-ChatGPT-Productively-in-VS-Code"><a href="#Use-ChatGPT-Productively-in-VS-Code" class="headerlink" title="Use ChatGPT Productively in VS Code"></a>Use ChatGPT Productively in VS Code</h2><p> ChatGPT and other generative AI models have found valuable uses in our daily lives.
