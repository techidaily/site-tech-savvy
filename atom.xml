While it’s easy just to visit a website and generate the image you’re looking for, open-source text-to-image generators are your best bet if you want more control over the generation process.</p><p><strong>MAKEUSEOF VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> There are dozens of free and open-source AI text-to-image generators available on the internet that specialize in specific kinds of images. So, we’ve sifted through the pile and found the best open-source AI text-to-image generators you can try right now.</p><h2 id="1-Craiyon"><a href="#1-Craiyon" class="headerlink" title="1 Craiyon"></a>1 Craiyon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/craiyon-home-page.jpg"                      alt="craiyon-home-page"                ></p><p> Craiyon is one of the most easily accessible open-source AI image generators. It’s based on DALL-E Mini, and while you can clone the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini" >Github repository <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the model locally on your computer, Craiyon seems to have dropped this approach in favor of its website.</p><p> The official Github repository hasn’t been updated since June 2022, but the latest model is still available for free on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.craiyon.com/" >official Craiyon site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There are no Android or iOS apps either.</p><p> In terms of functionality, you’ll see all the usual options that you expect from an AI image generator. Once you enter your prompt and get an image, you can use the upscale feature to get a higher-resolution copy. There are three styles to choose from: Art, Photo, and Drawing. You can also select the “None” option if you want the model to decide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/craiyon-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="craiyon-generated-image"                ></p><p> Additionally, “Expert Mode” lets you include negative words, which tells the model to avoid specific items. There’s also a prompt prediction feature, which uses ChatGPT to help users write the best, most detailed prompts possible. Lastly, the AI-powered remove background features can help you save time and effort cropping backgrounds out of images.</p><p> And that’s about everything Craiyon does. It’s not the most sophisticated AI image generation model, but it does well as a basic model if you don’t want something detailed or realistic.</p><p> The model is free to use, but free users are limited to nine free images at a time within a minute. You can subscribe to their Supporter or Professional tiers (priced at $5 and $20 a month, respectively, and billed annually) to get no ads or watermarks, faster generation, and the option to keep your generated images private. A Custom subscription tier also allows custom models, integration, dedicated support, and private servers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Stable-Diffusion-1-5"><a href="#2-Stable-Diffusion-1-5" class="headerlink" title="2 Stable Diffusion 1.5"></a>2 Stable Diffusion 1.5</h2><p> Stable Diffusion is perhaps one of the most popular open-source text-to-image generation models. It also powers other models, including the three image generators mentioned below. It was released in 2022 and has had many implementations since.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stable-diffusion-web-ui.jpg"                      alt="stable-diffusion-web-ui"                ></p><p> I’ll spare you the overly technical details of how the model works (for which you can check out their <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion" >official Github repository <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), but the model is easy to install even for complete beginners and works well as long as you have a dedicated GPU with at least 4GB of memory. You can also access <a class="link"   href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/" >Stable Diffusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> online, and we’ve got you covered if you want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-stable-diffusion-mac/" >run Stable Diffusion on a Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> There are several checkpoints (consider them versions) available to use for Stable Diffusion. While we tested out version 1.5, <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1" >version 2.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also in active development and is more precise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dreamshaper-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="dreamshaper-ai-generated-image"                ></p><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;DreamShaper</p><p> Running the model is also rather easy. We tested it with the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui" >AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion web user interface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and all controls and parameters work well. It’s also quite NSFW-proof courtesy of the LAION-5B database that the model trained on (although it’s not perfect, mind you). While generation time itself will vary based on your hardware, you can expect your images to be detailed and realistic even with basic prompts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-DreamShaper"><a href="#3-DreamShaper" class="headerlink" title="3 DreamShaper"></a>3 DreamShaper</h2><p> DreamShaper is an image generation model based on Stable Diffusion. It was intended as an open-source alternative to MidJourney and focuses on photorealism in the generated images, although it can handle anime and painting styles just as well with a few tweaks.</p><p> The model is more capable than Stable Diffusion, allowing users more freedom over the final output, ranging from lightning improvements to looser NSFW restrictions. Running the model is also easy, with a <a class="link"   href="https://civitai.com/models/4384?modelVersionId=128713" >downloadable, pre-trained version available <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> online for local access and a host of websites, including <a class="link"   href="https://sinkin.ai/m/4zdwGOB" >Sinkin.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://randomseed.co/?id=20" >RandomSeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.mage.space/" >Mage.space <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (requires a basic subscription) that let you run the model with GPU acceleration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dreamshaper-stablediffusion-comparison.jpg"                      alt="dreamshaper-stablediffusion-comparison"                ></p><p> As you can probably guess by now, images generated by DreamShaper tend to look more realistic compared to Stable Diffusion. Even if you run the same prompt on both models, the DreamShaper model will likely be more realistic, detailed, and better-lit.</p><p> This is especially true for portraits or characters, something I found Stable Diffusion lacking compared to the same prompt. If your images become too realistic, here are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-identify-ai-generated-image/" >four ways to identify an AI-generated image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> You don’t need a behemoth PC to run the model, either. My GTX 1650Ti with 4GB VRAM ran the model perfectly. Generation time was a bit longer, but it didn’t seem to affect the actual output. That said, you might require GPUs with more VRAM to run DreamShaper XL, which is based on the Stable Diffusion XL model.</p><h2 id="4-InvokeAI"><a href="#4-InvokeAI" class="headerlink" title="4 InvokeAI"></a>4 InvokeAI</h2><p> Invoke AI is another AI-based image generation model based on Stable Diffusion, with an XL version based on Stable Diffusion XL. It also has its own web and command line user interface, meaning you won’t have to jump hoops with things like the Stable Diffusion web UI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/invokeai-user-interface-with-image.jpg"                      alt="invokeai-user-interface-with-image"                ></p><p> The model focuses on letting users create visuals based on their intellectual property with customized workflows. InvokeAI is one of the best open-source AI image generation models for training custom models and working with intellectual property.</p><p> Its <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI?tab=readme-ov-file" >official Github repository <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lists two installation methods: installing via InvokeAI’s installer or using PyPI if you’re comfortable with a terminal and Python and need more control over the packages installed with the model.</p><p> However, the extra control does bring a few limitations, most notably stricter hardware requirements. InvokeAI recommends a dedicated GPU with at least 4GB of memory, with six to eight GB recommended for running the XL variant. The VRAM requirements apply to both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. You’ll also need at least 12GB of RAM and 12GB of free disk space for the model, its dependencies, and Python.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/invoke-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="invoke-ai-generated-image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;InvokeAI  </p><p> While the documentation doesn’t recommend Nvidia’s GTX 10 Series and 16 Series GPUs for their lack of video memory, the provided installer did run just fine. While your mileage may vary, if you’re on a lower-end GPU, expect to wait longer to see your prompts being turned into images. Finally, if you’re on Windows, you can only use an Nvidia GPU, as there’s no support for AMD GPUs currently.</p><p> For the image generation part, the model tends to lean more toward artistic styles than photorealism. Of course, you can train the model on your dataset and have it generate images closer to what you want, even if that involves photorealistic images, especially if you’re working in product design, architecture, or retail spaces. However, one important thing to keep in mind is that InvokeAI is primarily an image generation engine, meaning you’ll likely have to use your own models for the best results (easily found via the model manager provided in the web interface) as the default model is quite similar to Stable Diffusion itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Openjourney"><a href="#5-Openjourney" class="headerlink" title="5 Openjourney"></a>5 Openjourney</h2><p> Openjourney is a free, open-source AI image generation model based yet again on Stable Diffusion.

There are no Android or iOS apps either.</p><p> In terms of functionality, you’ll see all the usual options that you expect from an AI image generator. Once you enter your prompt and get an image, you can use the upscale feature to get a higher-resolution copy. There are three styles to choose from: Art, Photo, and Drawing. You can also select the “None” option if you want the model to decide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/craiyon-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="craiyon-generated-image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Additionally, “Expert Mode” lets you include negative words, which tells the model to avoid specific items. There’s also a prompt prediction feature, which uses ChatGPT to help users write the best, most detailed prompts possible. Lastly, the AI-powered remove background features can help you save time and effort cropping backgrounds out of images.</p><p> And that’s about everything Craiyon does. It’s not the most sophisticated AI image generation model, but it does well as a basic model if you don’t want something detailed or realistic.</p><p> The model is free to use, but free users are limited to nine free images at a time within a minute. You can subscribe to their Supporter or Professional tiers (priced at $5 and $20 a month, respectively, and billed annually) to get no ads or watermarks, faster generation, and the option to keep your generated images private. A Custom subscription tier also allows custom models, integration, dedicated support, and private servers.</p><h2 id="2-Stable-Diffusion-1-5-1"><a href="#2-Stable-Diffusion-1-5-1" class="headerlink" title="2 Stable Diffusion 1.5"></a>2 Stable Diffusion 1.5</h2><p> Stable Diffusion is perhaps one of the most popular open-source text-to-image generation models. It also powers other models, including the three image generators mentioned below. It was released in 2022 and has had many implementations since.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stable-diffusion-web-ui.jpg"                      alt="stable-diffusion-web-ui"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

You can also access <a class="link"   href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/" >Stable Diffusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> online, and we’ve got you covered if you want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-stable-diffusion-mac/" >run Stable Diffusion on a Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> There are several checkpoints (consider them versions) available to use for Stable Diffusion. While we tested out version 1.5, <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1" >version 2.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also in active development and is more precise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dreamshaper-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="dreamshaper-ai-generated-image"                ></p><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;DreamShaper</p><p> Running the model is also rather easy. We tested it with the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui" >AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion web user interface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and all controls and parameters work well. It’s also quite NSFW-proof courtesy of the LAION-5B database that the model trained on (although it’s not perfect, mind you). While generation time itself will vary based on your hardware, you can expect your images to be detailed and realistic even with basic prompts.</p><h2 id="3-DreamShaper-1"><a href="#3-DreamShaper-1" class="headerlink" title="3 DreamShaper"></a>3 DreamShaper</h2><p> DreamShaper is an image generation model based on Stable Diffusion. It was intended as an open-source alternative to MidJourney and focuses on photorealism in the generated images, although it can handle anime and painting styles just as well with a few tweaks.</p><p> The model is more capable than Stable Diffusion, allowing users more freedom over the final output, ranging from lightning improvements to looser NSFW restrictions. Running the model is also easy, with a <a class="link"   href="https://civitai.com/models/4384?modelVersionId=128713" >downloadable, pre-trained version available <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> online for local access and a host of websites, including <a class="link"   href="https://sinkin.ai/m/4zdwGOB" >Sinkin.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://randomseed.co/?id=20" >RandomSeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.mage.space/" >Mage.space <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (requires a basic subscription) that let you run the model with GPU acceleration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dreamshaper-stablediffusion-comparison.jpg"                      alt="dreamshaper-stablediffusion-comparison"                ></p><p> As you can probably guess by now, images generated by DreamShaper tend to look more realistic compared to Stable Diffusion. Even if you run the same prompt on both models, the DreamShaper model will likely be more realistic, detailed, and better-lit.</p><p> This is especially true for portraits or characters, something I found Stable Diffusion lacking compared to the same prompt. If your images become too realistic, here are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-identify-ai-generated-image/" >four ways to identify an AI-generated image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> You don’t need a behemoth PC to run the model, either. My GTX 1650Ti with 4GB VRAM ran the model perfectly. Generation time was a bit longer, but it didn’t seem to affect the actual output. That said, you might require GPUs with more VRAM to run DreamShaper XL, which is based on the Stable Diffusion XL model.</p><h2 id="4-InvokeAI-1"><a href="#4-InvokeAI-1" class="headerlink" title="4 InvokeAI"></a>4 InvokeAI</h2><p> Invoke AI is another AI-based image generation model based on Stable Diffusion, with an XL version based on Stable Diffusion XL. It also has its own web and command line user interface, meaning you won’t have to jump hoops with things like the Stable Diffusion web UI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/invokeai-user-interface-with-image.jpg"                      alt="invokeai-user-interface-with-image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The model focuses on letting users create visuals based on their intellectual property with customized workflows. InvokeAI is one of the best open-source AI image generation models for training custom models and working with intellectual property.</p><p> Its <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI?tab=readme-ov-file" >official Github repository <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lists two installation methods: installing via InvokeAI’s installer or using PyPI if you’re comfortable with a terminal and Python and need more control over the packages installed with the model.</p><p> However, the extra control does bring a few limitations, most notably stricter hardware requirements. InvokeAI recommends a dedicated GPU with at least 4GB of memory, with six to eight GB recommended for running the XL variant. The VRAM requirements apply to both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. You’ll also need at least 12GB of RAM and 12GB of free disk space for the model, its dependencies, and Python.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/invoke-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="invoke-ai-generated-image"                ></p><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;InvokeAI  </p><p> While the documentation doesn’t recommend Nvidia’s GTX 10 Series and 16 Series GPUs for their lack of video memory, the provided installer did run just fine. While your mileage may vary, if you’re on a lower-end GPU, expect to wait longer to see your prompts being turned into images. Finally, if you’re on Windows, you can only use an Nvidia GPU, as there’s no support for AMD GPUs currently.</p><p> For the image generation part, the model tends to lean more toward artistic styles than photorealism. Of course, you can train the model on your dataset and have it generate images closer to what you want, even if that involves photorealistic images, especially if you’re working in product design, architecture, or retail spaces. However, one important thing to keep in mind is that InvokeAI is primarily an image generation engine, meaning you’ll likely have to use your own models for the best results (easily found via the model manager provided in the web interface) as the default model is quite similar to Stable Diffusion itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Openjourney-1"><a href="#5-Openjourney-1" class="headerlink" title="5 Openjourney"></a>5 Openjourney</h2><p> Openjourney is a free, open-source AI image generation model based yet again on Stable Diffusion.

Openjourney is also the second most downloaded AI image generation model on HuggingFace, right behind Stable Diffusion.</p><p> Openjourney doesn’t list any specific hardware requirements for running the model locally on its website, but you can expect similar hardware requirements to Stable Diffusion.

While your mileage may vary, if you’re on a lower-end GPU, expect to wait longer to see your prompts being turned into images. Finally, if you’re on Windows, you can only use an Nvidia GPU, as there’s no support for AMD GPUs currently.</p><p> For the image generation part, the model tends to lean more toward artistic styles than photorealism. Of course, you can train the model on your dataset and have it generate images closer to what you want, even if that involves photorealistic images, especially if you’re working in product design, architecture, or retail spaces. However, one important thing to keep in mind is that InvokeAI is primarily an image generation engine, meaning you’ll likely have to use your own models for the best results (easily found via the model manager provided in the web interface) as the default model is quite similar to Stable Diffusion itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Openjourney-2"><a href="#5-Openjourney-2" class="headerlink" title="5 Openjourney"></a>5 Openjourney</h2><p> Openjourney is a free, open-source AI image generation model based yet again on Stable Diffusion.

While we tested out version 1.5, <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1" >version 2.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also in active development and is more precise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dreamshaper-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="dreamshaper-ai-generated-image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;DreamShaper</p><p> Running the model is also rather easy. We tested it with the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui" >AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion web user interface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and all controls and parameters work well. It’s also quite NSFW-proof courtesy of the LAION-5B database that the model trained on (although it’s not perfect, mind you). While generation time itself will vary based on your hardware, you can expect your images to be detailed and realistic even with basic prompts.</p><h2 id="3-DreamShaper-3"><a href="#3-DreamShaper-3" class="headerlink" title="3 DreamShaper"></a>3 DreamShaper</h2><p> DreamShaper is an image generation model based on Stable Diffusion. It was intended as an open-source alternative to MidJourney and focuses on photorealism in the generated images, although it can handle anime and painting styles just as well with a few tweaks.</p><p> The model is more capable than Stable Diffusion, allowing users more freedom over the final output, ranging from lightning improvements to looser NSFW restrictions. Running the model is also easy, with a <a class="link"   href="https://civitai.com/models/4384?modelVersionId=128713" >downloadable, pre-trained version available <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> online for local access and a host of websites, including <a class="link"   href="https://sinkin.ai/m/4zdwGOB" >Sinkin.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://randomseed.co/?id=20" >RandomSeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.mage.space/" >Mage.space <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (requires a basic subscription) that let you run the model with GPU acceleration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dreamshaper-stablediffusion-comparison.jpg"                      alt="dreamshaper-stablediffusion-comparison"                ></p><p> As you can probably guess by now, images generated by DreamShaper tend to look more realistic compared to Stable Diffusion. Even if you run the same prompt on both models, the DreamShaper model will likely be more realistic, detailed, and better-lit.</p><p> This is especially true for portraits or characters, something I found Stable Diffusion lacking compared to the same prompt. If your images become too realistic, here are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-identify-ai-generated-image/" >four ways to identify an AI-generated image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> You don’t need a behemoth PC to run the model, either. My GTX 1650Ti with 4GB VRAM ran the model perfectly. Generation time was a bit longer, but it didn’t seem to affect the actual output. That said, you might require GPUs with more VRAM to run DreamShaper XL, which is based on the Stable Diffusion XL model.</p><h2 id="4-InvokeAI-3"><a href="#4-InvokeAI-3" class="headerlink" title="4 InvokeAI"></a>4 InvokeAI</h2><p> Invoke AI is another AI-based image generation model based on Stable Diffusion, with an XL version based on Stable Diffusion XL. It also has its own web and command line user interface, meaning you won’t have to jump hoops with things like the Stable Diffusion web UI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/invokeai-user-interface-with-image.jpg"                      alt="invokeai-user-interface-with-image"                ></p><p> The model focuses on letting users create visuals based on their intellectual property with customized workflows. InvokeAI is one of the best open-source AI image generation models for training custom models and working with intellectual property.</p><p> Its <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI?tab=readme-ov-file" >official Github repository <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lists two installation methods: installing via InvokeAI’s installer or using PyPI if you’re comfortable with a terminal and Python and need more control over the packages installed with the model.</p><p> However, the extra control does bring a few limitations, most notably stricter hardware requirements. InvokeAI recommends a dedicated GPU with at least 4GB of memory, with six to eight GB recommended for running the XL variant. The VRAM requirements apply to both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. You’ll also need at least 12GB of RAM and 12GB of free disk space for the model, its dependencies, and Python.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/invoke-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="invoke-ai-generated-image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BSQL%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/sql-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;InvokeAI  </p><p> While the documentation doesn’t recommend Nvidia’s GTX 10 Series and 16 Series GPUs for their lack of video memory, the provided installer did run just fine. While your mileage may vary, if you’re on a lower-end GPU, expect to wait longer to see your prompts being turned into images. Finally, if you’re on Windows, you can only use an Nvidia GPU, as there’s no support for AMD GPUs currently.</p><p> For the image generation part, the model tends to lean more toward artistic styles than photorealism. Of course, you can train the model on your dataset and have it generate images closer to what you want, even if that involves photorealistic images, especially if you’re working in product design, architecture, or retail spaces. However, one important thing to keep in mind is that InvokeAI is primarily an image generation engine, meaning you’ll likely have to use your own models for the best results (easily found via the model manager provided in the web interface) as the default model is quite similar to Stable Diffusion itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Openjourney-3"><a href="#5-Openjourney-3" class="headerlink" title="5 Openjourney"></a>5 Openjourney</h2><p> Openjourney is a free, open-source AI image generation model based yet again on Stable Diffusion. If you’re wondering why the model is called Openjourney, it’s because it was trained on Midjourney images and can mimic its style in the images it generates.</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://prompthero.com/create" >PromptHero <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the company behind Openjourney, lets you test the model alongside other models, including Stable Diffusion (versions 1.5 and 2), DreamShaper, and Realistic Vision. When signing up, you get 25 free credits (one credit for each image generated), after which you have to subscribe to their Pro subscription tier, which costs $9 a month and gives you access to 300 credits each month with other exclusive features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/openjourney-stablediffusion-comparison.jpg"                      alt="openjourney-stablediffusion-comparison"                ></p><p> However, if you want to run it locally and for free, you can <a class="link"   href="https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney" >download the model file from HuggingFace <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and run it using the Stable Diffusion web UI. Openjourney is also the second most downloaded AI image generation model on HuggingFace, right behind Stable Diffusion.</p><p> Openjourney doesn’t list any specific hardware requirements for running the model locally on its website, but you can expect similar hardware requirements to Stable Diffusion. This means a dedicated GPU with 4GB VRAM, 16GB RAM, and around 12 to 15GB of free space on your computer to save the model and its dependencies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/openjourney-ai-generated-image.jpg"                      alt="openjourney-ai-generated-image"                ></p><p>Yadullah Abidi&#x2F;MakeUseOf&#x2F;OpenJourney</p><p> Images generated by Openjourney tend to be balanced between photorealism and art unless otherwise specified.

The most obvious reason is to protect your privacy. ChatGPT records all conversations you have with it and stores them (see: <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/shouldnt-trust-chatgpt-confidential-data/" >why you shouldn’t trust ChatGPT with private information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).

From GPT-1 to GPT-4, these models have been at the forefront of AI-generated content, from creating prose and poetry to chatbots and even coding.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But what is the difference between each GPT model, and what’s their impact on the field of NLP?</p><h2 id="What-Are-Generative-Pre-Trained-Transformers"><a href="#What-Are-Generative-Pre-Trained-Transformers" class="headerlink" title="What Are Generative Pre-Trained Transformers?"></a>What Are Generative Pre-Trained Transformers?</h2><p> Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) are a type of machine learning model used for natural language processing tasks. These models are pre-trained on massive amounts of data, such as books and web pages, to generate contextually relevant and semantically coherent language.</p><p> In simpler terms, GPTs are computer programs that can create human-like text without being explicitly programmed to do so. As a result, they can be fine-tuned for a range of natural language processing tasks, including question-answering, language translation, and text summarization.</p><p> So, why are GPTs important? GPTs represent a significant breakthrough in natural language processing, allowing machines to understand and generate language with unprecedented fluency and accuracy. Below, we explore the four GPT models, from the first version to the most recent GPT-4, and examine their performance and limitations.</p><h2 id="GPT-1"><a href="#GPT-1" class="headerlink" title="GPT-1"></a>GPT-1</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rup-ai-chatgpt4.jpg"                      alt="Art of an AI robot"                ></p><p> GPT-1 was released in 2018 by OpenAI as their first iteration of a language model using the Transformer architecture. It had 117 million parameters, significantly improving previous state-of-the-art language models.</p><p> One of the strengths of GPT-1 was its ability to generate fluent and coherent language when given a prompt or context. The model was trained on a combination of two datasets: the <a class="link"   href="https://commoncrawl.org/" >Common Crawl <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a massive dataset of web pages with billions of words, and the BookCorpus dataset, a collection of over 11,000 books on a variety of genres. The use of these diverse datasets allowed GPT-1 to develop strong language modeling abilities.</p><p> While GPT-1 was a significant achievement in <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/" >natural language processing (NLP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it had certain limitations. For example, the model was prone to generating repetitive text, especially when given prompts outside the scope of its training data. It also failed to reason over multiple turns of dialogue and could not track long-term dependencies in text. Additionally, its cohesion and fluency were only limited to shorter text sequences, and longer passages would lack cohesion.</p><p> Despite these limitations, GPT-1 laid the foundation for larger and more powerful models based on the Transformer architecture.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="GPT-2"><a href="#GPT-2" class="headerlink" title="GPT-2"></a>GPT-2</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gpt-3.jpg"                      alt="gpt 3 featured"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> GPT-2 was released in 2019 by OpenAI as a successor to GPT-1. It contained a staggering 1.5 billion parameters, considerably larger than GPT-1. The model was trained on a much larger and more diverse dataset, combining Common Crawl and WebText.</p><p> One of the strengths of GPT-2 was its ability to generate coherent and realistic sequences of text. In addition, it could generate human-like responses, making it a valuable tool for various natural language processing tasks, such as content creation and translation.</p><p> However, GPT-2 was not without its limitations. It struggled with tasks that required more complex reasoning and understanding of context. While GPT-2 excelled at short paragraphs and snippets of text, it failed to maintain context and coherence over longer passages.</p><p> These limitations paved the way for the development of the next iteration of GPT models.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="GPT-3"><a href="#GPT-3" class="headerlink" title="GPT-3"></a>GPT-3</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/176a1a151aeb9ebfdcfd4bd623625c32ca353b5d86117d513193a67649a60b72.jpg"                      alt="Image of a laptop with AI on the screen and ChatGPT in different fonts in the background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Natural language processing models made exponential leaps with the release of GPT-3 in 2020. With 175 billion parameters, GPT-3 is over 100 times larger than GPT-1 and over ten times larger than GPT-2.</p><p> GPT-3 is trained on a diverse range of data sources, including BookCorpus, Common Crawl, and Wikipedia, among others. The datasets comprise nearly a trillion words, allowing GPT-3 to generate sophisticated responses on a wide range of NLP tasks, even without providing any prior example data.</p><p> One of the main improvements of GPT-3 over its previous models is its ability to generate coherent text, write computer code, and even create art. Unlike the previous models, GPT-3 understands the context of a given text and can generate appropriate responses. The ability to produce natural-sounding text has huge implications for applications like chatbots, content creation, and language translation. One such example is ChatGPT, a conversational AI bot, which <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-became-fastest-growing-app/" >went from obscurity to fame almost overnight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> While GPT-3 can do some incredible things, it still has flaws. For example, the model can return biased, inaccurate, or inappropriate responses. This issue arises because GPT-3 is trained on massive amounts of text that possibly contain biased and inaccurate information. There are also instances when the model generates totally irrelevant text to a prompt, indicating that the model still has difficulty understanding context and background knowledge.</p><p> The capabilities of GPT-3 also raised concerns about the ethical implications and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/advanced-ai-will-make-scams-harder-to-spot-heres-why/" >potential misuse of such powerful language models <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Experts worry about the possibility of the model being used for malicious purposes, like generating fake news, phishing emails, and malware. Indeed, we’ve already seen <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-used-by-cybercriminals-to-write-malware/" >criminals use ChatGPT to create malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> OpenAI also released an improved version of GPT-3, GPT-3.5, before officially launching GPT-4.</p><h2 id="GPT-4"><a href="#GPT-4" class="headerlink" title="GPT-4"></a>GPT-4</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/openai-gpt4-model-chatgpt-upgrade.jpg"                      alt="openai gpt4 model chatgpt upgrade"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end --> GPT-4 is the latest model in the GPT series, launched on March 14, 2023\. It's a significant step up from its previous model, GPT-3, which was already impressive. While the specifics of the model's training data and architecture are not officially announced, it certainly builds upon the strengths of GPT-3 and overcomes some of its limitations.<p> GPT-4 is exclusive to ChatGPT Plus users, but the usage limit is capped. You can also gain access to it by joining the GPT-4 API waitlist, which might take some time due to the high volume of applications. However, the easiest way to get your hands on GPT-4 is <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-chat-best-generative-ai-chatbot/" >using Microsoft Bing Chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s completely free and there’s no need to join a waitlist.</p><p> A standout feature of GPT-4 is its multimodal capabilities. This means that the model can now accept an image as input and understand it like a text prompt. For example, during the GPT-4 launch live stream, an OpenAI engineer fed the model with an image of a hand-drawn website mockup, and the model surprisingly provided a working code for the website.</p><p> The model also better understands complex prompts and exhibits human-level performance on several professional and traditional benchmarks. Additionally, it has a larger context window and context size, which refers to the data the model can retain in its memory during a chat session.</p><p> GPT-4 is pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible with AI tools, and it will likely have applications in a wide range of industries. However, as with any powerful technology, there are concerns about the potential misuse and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/signs-ai-development-is-moving-too-fast/" >ethical implications of such a powerful tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Launch Date</th><th>Training Data</th><th>No. of Parameters</th><th>Max.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Harness-the-Power-of-AI-Key-Strategies-with-ChatGPT-for-Enhanced-Efficiency"><a href="#Harness-the-Power-of-AI-Key-Strategies-with-ChatGPT-for-Enhanced-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Harness the Power of AI: Key Strategies with ChatGPT for Enhanced Efficiency"></a>Harness the Power of AI: Key Strategies with ChatGPT for Enhanced Efficiency</h2><p> The next time you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed by a packed schedule or looming deadline, why not let AI help you out? In addition to its text generation capabilities, ChatGPT can also help you become more productive and efficient with effective time management skills.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Whether you’re looking to prioritize your to-do list, tackle a large project, or simply get through your day effectively, ChatGPT can offer personalized advice for your day-to-day activities and make the most of your time.</p><h2 id="1-Get-Advice-on-How-to-Prioritize-Your-Tasks"><a href="#1-Get-Advice-on-How-to-Prioritize-Your-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="1. Get Advice on How to Prioritize Your Tasks"></a>1. Get Advice on How to Prioritize Your Tasks</h2><p> ChatGPT can advise you on common task prioritization methods, such as the Eisenhower Matrix, ABCD Method, and the MoSCoW Method. It can also help you choose the most suitable method based on your specific needs and goals.</p><p> For instance, imagine you have a packed schedule for the day and don’t know where to start. Enter your tasks into ChatGPT, prompt it to sort things into an Eisenhower Matrix, and get a better sense of your priorities in an instant.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-eisenhower-matrix-example-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Eisenhower Matrix example prompt"                ></p><p> This approach is named for <a class="link"   href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-second-assembly-the-world-council-churches-evanston-illinois" >U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , who once quoted a former college president’s philosophy about time management in a speech.</p><p> “I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent,” said Eisenhower.</p><p> Following this line of thinking, the Eisenhower Matrix approach helps you sort through tasks based on their importance and urgency. It’s a quick way to help you figure out what actually deserves your attention.</p><p> For a different approach, ChatGPT can also streamline your tasks based on the ABCD Method. It’s another <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/task-management-tips-improve-productivity/" >popular task management approach <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and the chatbot makes using it a cinch. In the prompt, list your tasks for the day and ask it to apply the ABCD Method.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-abcd-method-part-one.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT ABCD Method part one"                ></p><p> If you have a list of pending tasks and don’t know where to start, ChatGPT can take a guess at which ones are likely the most important using the ABCD Method. Even if you disagree with the app’s initial sorting, it’s a quick way to gauge your priorities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-abcd-method-part-two.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT ABCD Method part two"                ></p><p> As this example shows, the chatbot sorts your activities into assignments that require immediate attention (such as working your shift for the day), as well as those that can go on the back burner for a little while (such as returning a call to your doctor’s office).</p><p> When crafting your prompt, be as specific as possible, and don’t hesitate to rephrase the question or regenerate your first response. In this case, list out every item on your to-do list if you like, and note which tasks are time-sensitive or otherwise critical.</p><p> Although <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/" >learning how to write effective ChatGPT prompts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can take a little time and experimentation, it’s well worth the effort. For the most part, giving the chatbot a lot of information to work with, as well as engaging in conversational follow-up questions and clarifications, will provide more helpful responses.</p><p> For the most part, the chatbot can help you determine which of your many tasks deserves your attention the most. For anyone who gets overwhelmed by too many pending responsibilities, this is a simple way to let technology take on a little of the decision-making for you.</p><h2 id="2-Streamline-Your-Workflow-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#2-Streamline-Your-Workflow-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="2. Streamline Your Workflow With ChatGPT"></a>2. Streamline Your Workflow With ChatGPT</h2><p> Depending on your profession, ChatGPT can also offer specific advice for speeding up your workflow. In this example, we prompted the chatbot to address a common time suck: reading and responding to emails.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-email-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT email prompt"                ></p><p> For this prompt, the chatbot provided some general advice about using templates and unsubscribing from as much as possible. However, you can also drill down to get more specific advice for these issues as well.</p><p> In this case, we prompted the chatbot to free up time wasted on unimportant emails.

Break Down a Large Project Into Manageable Sections</h2><p> ChatGPT can help guide you through breaking down large projects, whether you’re planning to do some home renovation, switch careers, or even launch a podcast. In this case, we prompted the chatbot to help make the process of decluttering a room—something many people find a bit overwhelming—much faster and easier.</p><p> In instances like these, you can even prompt ChatGPT to assume various roles. In this case, we had it present the information like a professional organizer, with a focus on getting through the process as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-decluttering-prompt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT decluttering prompt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The chatbot provided a series of tips for decluttering more efficiently. Many of them focused on speeding up the process, such as the advice to make rapid decisions about whether to keep or donate a particular item.</p><p> The next time you have a large project to tackle, see whether ChatGPT can help you sort through the steps to make it more manageable and efficient.

Tailor the prompts to suit your specific needs (i.e., “provide time-saving tips for people with a long commute” or “provide time-saving tips for software developers”).</p><p> In this case, we requested time-saving tips for people who struggle with procrastination. After all, the tendency to procrastinate is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/time-management-mistakes-to-avoid/" >biggest time management mistakes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that many people face from time to time.

You tirelessly scour job boards and spend hours crafting the perfect application, only to get nothing in return. But what if you could break free from the time-consuming, effort-intensive job search cycle and adopt smarter ways to find your dream job?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> What if ChatGPT could help you transform your job search experience? We’ve put together six practical ways to use ChatGPT in your job search. Here’s how.</p><h2 id="1-Make-Sense-of-Job-Post-Descriptions"><a href="#1-Make-Sense-of-Job-Post-Descriptions" class="headerlink" title="1. Make Sense of Job Post Descriptions"></a>1. Make Sense of Job Post Descriptions</h2><p> Job postings can sometimes be overwhelming. They are often packed with technical jargon and niche language. This can make it challenging to understand what the job entails, which is what you’ll really need to know once you come across a job ad.</p><p> ChatGPT can help you analyze job posts to give you a clear picture of what a job is really about. It will also use this picture of what the job entails to guide you through what to include in your resume and cover letter, as well as the skills to emphasize.</p><p> In an era where recruiters use software to scan and filter through thousands of job applications to find the best candidates, ChatGPT can help you identify the keywords and phrases that recruiters and hiring managers will be looking for. But how can you do this with ChatGPT?</p><p> I’ll provide you with a job description in my next prompt. Your goal is to help me make sense of the job description and use it to answer questions I’ll be asking.</p><ol><li>Copy and paste the prompt above or a variation that suits your needs.</li><li>Copy and paste the job post. Provide as much information as you can find.</li><li>If after pasting the job post, ChatGPT does not start explaining the job role, use a prompt like “make sense of the job description above” to get the chatbot to describe the job role.</li><li>After ChatGPT finishes the preliminary explanation, you now start asking questions. You can ask questions like:  <ul><li>What are some keywords or phrases that I should include in my resume or cover letter when applying for this job?  </li><li>Can you suggest any specific experiences that I should highlight in my application?</li></ul></li></ol><p> By using ChatGPT to make sense of job descriptions, you can precisely tailor your application materials for each job you apply for and increase your chances of getting hired.</p><h2 id="2-Create-Resumes-and-Cover-Letters"><a href="#2-Create-Resumes-and-Cover-Letters" class="headerlink" title="2.

One of such hurdles is creating resumes and cover letters—a lot of them. While the bulk of creative inputs in your resumes and cover letters should come from you, ChatGPT can help you improve the quality of your resumes, and produce a lot of copies in a short time.</p><p> You see, when on a job search, there is a good chance that you’ll be applying to many companies. With this in mind, you’ll need a lot of personalized resumes specially crafted to target each company you are applying to.</p><p> Manually crafting personalized resumes and cover letters for each company can be a tedious task. But if you furnish ChatGPT with important professional information, the AI chatbot can generate multiple personalized documents simultaneously.</p><p> Just asking ChatGPT to whip up a resume isn’t going to cut it if you’re hoping to create a truly impressive and effective one. But don’t panic; we’ve previously put together a detailed <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-to-write-resume/" >step-by-step guide on how to create a resume with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-cover-letter-using-chatgpt/" >guide to creating a cover letter with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Prepare-for-Interviews"><a href="#3-Prepare-for-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="3.

Prepare for Interviews</h2><p> You’ve jumped through all the hurdles of identifying a job opportunity, researching the company, crafting a fitting resume, and now you’ve gotten an invitation. There’s just one thing standing in your way—the interview.</p><p> Fortunately, like almost everything in your job search journey, ChatGPT can also help with that. If you’re unsure how to prep ChatGPT for a mock interview, here’s a good template prompt to help you get started.</p><p> I would like to role-play an interview scenario with you, where you act as the interviewer, and I will be the candidate applying for the PHP software developer position in your company. Your company is ABC Ltd, a language learning and translation startup that offers language translation services and language opportunities. Your role is to ask me interview questions one by one and wait for my answers. Please do not provide explanations or write the entire conversation at once. Treat it like a real interview and ask follow-up questions based on my responses. While asking follow-up questions, do not go down the rabbit hole. The depth of a follow-up should be 2 to 5 questions before asking a new set of questions. To begin, my first prompt is ‘Hi.’</p><p> read more</p><p> To use the prompt template above, replace the placeholder position and company details with a job role, company name, and description of what the company does. During the interview, you can ask ChatGPT to critique your responses to a question and rate how you’re doing so far.</p><h2 id="4-Prepare-for-Salary-Negotiation"><a href="#4-Prepare-for-Salary-Negotiation" class="headerlink" title="4. Prepare for Salary Negotiation"></a>4. Prepare for Salary Negotiation</h2><p> Salary negotiations are typically one of the trickiest parts of the interview process. You’d want as much money as possible, but you don’t want to appear too ambitious. ChatGPT can help you strike a balance and deal with this dilemma like a pro. But how?</p><p> You can use the AI chatbot to research a reasonable salary for your industry, specific company, and particular role. How’s that different from simply googling? Well, Google would provide a lot of generic information, but ChatGPT can take a lot of things into consideration when responding.</p><p> To effectively use ChatGPT for salary research, you’ll need to first provide the chatbot with your level of experience, the country, and state where the job is located, whether the job will be remote or onsite, and as much job-related information as possible. After providing this information, you can then prompt the chatbot for help in deciding on a suitable range of salary to settle for.</p><p> In the screenshot below, we asked ChatGPT to list some factors a jobseeker with 15 years of experience in the programming field who is applying for a programming writer role in a start-up at the heart of California should consider.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salary-range-negotiation.jpg"                      alt="Salary range negotiation using ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Of course, you can ask for the exact salary range or any other details that interest you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Identify-Career-Opportunities"><a href="#5-Identify-Career-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="5. Identify Career Opportunities"></a>5. Identify Career Opportunities</h2><p> The job market is like an iceberg; you only get to see a portion of its actual size. Advertised jobs are only a small fraction of the opportunities that exist. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shining-light-hidden-job-market-andrew-seaman/" >poll on LinkedIn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as much as 50% to 70% of job openings fall under the “hidden job market” category, meaning they are never posted publicly. This hidden market is vast and largely untapped, leaving many opportunities waiting to be discovered.</p><p> So, if you rely only on job boards and LinkedIn to find your next opportunity, you could miss out on a world of possibilities. But how do you find unadvertised opportunities? Well, you can start by proactively reaching out to companies, and ChatGPT can help you with that.</p><p> In the screenshot below, we asked ChatGPT to identify some potential job opportunities at Microsoft for a technical writer. It gave some good hints. Of course, your target company doesn’t have to be Microsoft.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/identify-career-opportunities.jpg"                      alt="Identify career opportunities"                ></p><p> We also asked ChatGPT to suggest some roles that could potentially be available in an advertising firm for somehow who has video animation skills. Here are some of the roles ChatGPT suggested we should apply for:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/video-animator-job-suggestions.jpg"                      alt="video animator job suggestions"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --> Using ChatGPT to sniff out potential job opportunities isn't too complex.

If you haven’t heard already, the two are now officially available for integration into third-party software. These cutting-edge tools harness the power of state-of-the-art language models to enable more advanced and nuanced conversations.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> This release is poised to shake things up with a huge impact on the world of business. ChatGPT has been quite the talk since late 2022, then what’s this buzz surrounding the ChatGPT and Whisper APIs?</p><h2 id="OpenAI-Grants-Access-to-ChatGPT-and-Whisper-APIs"><a href="#OpenAI-Grants-Access-to-ChatGPT-and-Whisper-APIs" class="headerlink" title="OpenAI Grants Access to ChatGPT and Whisper APIs"></a>OpenAI Grants Access to ChatGPT and Whisper APIs</h2><p> The ChatGPT API is powered by the <strong>gpt-3.5-turbo</strong> language model, which is the same model that’s used in ChatGPT. This means you can now get access to all the capabilities of ChatGPT through this API.</p><p> The developer community has lauded Whisper for its impressive capabilities, but it has been reported to be challenging to set up and run. However, OpenAI has made the <strong>large-v2</strong> model of Whisper available through its API, which offers improved speed and accessibility.</p><h3 id="Pricing"><a href="#Pricing" class="headerlink" title="Pricing"></a>Pricing</h3><p> OpenAI now gives you 1,000 tokens at a rate of $0.002, which it claims is 10x cheaper than the existing GPT-3.5 models. Even though 1,000 tokens may seem like a lot, sending just one snippet of text for the API to respond to could cost several tokens. In the official ChatGPT API announcement post, <a class="link"   href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis" >OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mentioned:</p><blockquote><p>“Through a series of system-wide optimizations, we’ve achieved 90% cost reduction for ChatGPT since December; we’re now passing through those savings to API users.”</p></blockquote><p> Whisper’s large-v2 model is priced at $0.006&#x2F;minute (of audio input), which is also cheaper.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Access-to-the-API"><a href="#Access-to-the-API" class="headerlink" title="Access to the API"></a>Access to the API</h3><p> GPT models take in unstructured text and represent it as a sequence of <strong>tokens</strong> for the model to understand. But with ChatGPT models, the input is consumed as a sequence of messages along with metadata. Even though the input is still processed as a sequence of tokens using the ChatML (Chat Markup Language) format, it allows for a more conversational experience.

For starters, you could use the AI tool to provide you with nutrition advice, including general recommendations on healthy eating habits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-2023-02-09-at-1-48-14-pm.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT giving health advice"                ></p><p> It can also be used to generate advice on weekly meal plans based on your body type, sex, activity level, age, food preferences, and health goals (whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or something else).</p><p> You could also use ChatGPT to generate workout plans based on your fitness level, goals, and even the type of equipment or time you have available. It may direct you to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-yoga-apps-help-workout-anywhere/" >great yoga app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or one of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-workout-apps/" >the best workout apps to get in shape <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> When it comes to sleeping better, the AI model can offer you tips and recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, such as helping you create a wind-down routine or offering advice on how to create a relaxing, sleep-inducing environment.</p><p> You could also use ChatGPT to provide information on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including how to protect yourself from illness. Or you can ask it to make recommendations for cancer screenings based on your factors (e.g. age, sex, and family history).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Limitations-of-Relying-on-ChatGPT-for-Health-and-Fitness-Advice"><a href="#Limitations-of-Relying-on-ChatGPT-for-Health-and-Fitness-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Relying on ChatGPT for Health and Fitness Advice"></a>Limitations of Relying on ChatGPT for Health and Fitness Advice</h2><p> It’s important to remember that AI technology is only as good as the data it’s trained on. According to ChatGPT’s developers,<a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-general-faq" >Open AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , “ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.”</p><p> In addition, the developers note, “ChatGPT will occasionally make up facts or ‘hallucinate’ outputs.” This is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >biggest problems with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s certainly a reason to be especially vigilant when evaluating the health and wellness responses you receive from the AI model. It’s why OpenAI itself recommends checking the accuracy of responses.</p><p> In addition, ChatGPT does not currently cite its sources like other AI systems (e.g.<a class="link"   href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" >Perplexity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). While it’s worth noting that even the advice provided by doctors evolves over time and may be limited by current scientific knowledge, it’s important to verify medical information with reliable sources, such as your doctor. ChatGPT’s limited knowledge of the world after 2021 means it may not be aware of the most current health advice or advances.</p><p> If you’re going to use ChatGPT as one source of health and fitness advice, there are some tips and tricks you can follow to improve the quality of information you receive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-and-Tricks-for-Improving-Relevance-of-Health-and-Fitness-Recommendations"><a href="#Tips-and-Tricks-for-Improving-Relevance-of-Health-and-Fitness-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Tips and Tricks for Improving Relevance of Health and Fitness Recommendations"></a>Tips and Tricks for Improving Relevance of Health and Fitness Recommendations</h2><p> Here are some tips and tricks for getting the most reliable health and fitness information from ChatGPT:</p><ul><li><strong>Fact check</strong> . Because ChatGPT can be prone to providing false or inaccurate information, you need to compare its recommendations with other sources and healthcare professionals. You could even ask ChatGPT to direct you to reputable sources of health and fitness information.</li><li><strong>Consider the context</strong> . Because health and fitness advice can vary so much between individuals, you will want to provide the model with as much personal information as possible, including your health history, goals, and current circumstances, before asking it to generate a response.</li><li><strong>Ask for clarification</strong> . If the information provided by ChatGPT seems unclear or incomplete, ask it for additional information. You can even ask ChatGPT to ask you questions to better understand your individual needs before providing you with a response.</li><li><strong>Be specific</strong> . The information provided by ChatGPT will be as specific as you ask it to be. For instance, if you ask it simple, single-sentence questions such as, “How can I lose weight?” you’ll get general responses. However, if you figure out how to focus the model with parameters and guidelines, it is more likely to provide the advice you can use.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-Use-ChatGPT-to-Get-Trustworthy-Health-Information"><a href="#Can-You-Use-ChatGPT-to-Get-Trustworthy-Health-Information" class="headerlink" title="Can You Use ChatGPT to Get Trustworthy Health Information?"></a>Can You Use ChatGPT to Get Trustworthy Health Information?</h2><p> So, can ChatGPT be trusted for health and fitness advice? The answer is, as with most things in life, it depends. Would you use Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook for health and wellness advice? You might, but you shouldn’t rely on those as your only sources of information.</p><p> But you use these services for inspiration, reminders, and support on your health and fitness journey! Similarly, you should use ChatGPT as just one tool in your wellness toolkit, and always make informed decisions based on sources you trust.</p><p> In the end, the decision to use ChatGPT for health and fitness advice is up to you. Be aware of its potential benefits and drawbacks as you weigh its answers. Just like with any online source of information, it’s always a good idea to take its advice with a grain of salt and to do additional research before making any major changes to your health and fitness routine.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-effective-strategies-for-removing-youtube-media-from-computers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Effective Strategies for Removing YouTube Media From Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exposing-the-accelerating-path-of-8-youtube-content-creators/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Exposing the Accelerating Path of 8 YouTube Content Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-broadcasting-brilliance-how-to-capture-compelling-sports-content/"><u>[New] Broadcasting Brilliance  How to Capture Compelling Sports Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-restore-lost-sounds-to-twitter-vids/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Restore Lost Sounds to Twitter Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-uncharted-territory-6-secrets-to-documenting-your-minecraft-journey/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Uncharted Territory  6 Secrets to Documenting Your Minecraft Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlock-screen-saving-potential-on-android-devices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlock Screen Saving Potential on Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-colorful-snaps-embrace-snapchats-anime-filters/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Colorful Snaps  Embrace Snapchat's Anime Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-vs-fortune-tellers-which-shines-light-on-tomorrow/"><u>AI Vs.

One thing everyone agrees on, however, is that AI needs stricter monitoring.</p><p> Despite the importance of AI regulation, it has taken a back seat to training. Developers are so obsessed with building the next biggest AI model that they’re trading cybersecurity for rapid advancement. The question isn’t if AI needs regulation; it’s which governing body with adequate funding, human resources, and technological capacity will take the initiative.</p><p> So, who should regulate AI?</p><h2 id="Government-Bodies"><a href="#Government-Bodies" class="headerlink" title="Government Bodies"></a>Government Bodies</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/government-institution-building.jpg"                      alt="White Government Institution Building With High Stairs"                ></p><p> Various people, from consumers to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-global-tech-leaders-think-about-ai/" >tech leaders, hope the government will regulate AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Publicly funded institutions have the resources to do so. Even Elon Musk and Sam Altman, two main drivers of the AI race, believe that some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-what-dangers-does-artificial-intelligence-pose/" >privacy concerns surrounding AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are too dangerous for governing bodies to overlook.</p><p> The government should focus on protecting its constituents’ privacy and civil liberties if it takes over AI regulation. Cybercriminals keep finding ways to exploit AI systems in their schemes. Individuals not well-versed in AI might easily get fooled by synthesized voices, deepfake videos, and bot-operated online profiles.</p><p> However, one major issue with the government regulating AI is that it might inadvertently stifle innovation. AI is a complex, evolving technology. Unless the officials overseeing deployment, development, and training guidelines understand how AI works, they might make premature, inefficient judgments.</p><h2 id="AI-Developers-Tech-Companies-and-Laboratories"><a href="#AI-Developers-Tech-Companies-and-Laboratories" class="headerlink" title="AI Developers, Tech Companies, and Laboratories"></a>AI Developers, Tech Companies, and Laboratories</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/two-researchers-training-robot-arm.jpg"                      alt="Male and Female Researchers Training White Robot Arm"                ></p><p> Considering the potential roadblocks that might arise from the government monitoring AI, many would rather have tech companies spearhead regulation. They believe developers should be responsible for the tech they release. Self-regulation enables them to drive innovation and focus on advancing these systems efficiently.</p><p> Moreover, their in-depth understanding of AI will help them make fair, informed guidelines prioritizing user safety without compromising functionality. As with any technology, industry expertise streamlines monitoring. Assigning untrained officials to regulate technologies they barely understand might present more problems than benefits.</p><p> Take the 2018 U.S. Senate hearing about Facebook’s data privacy laws as an example. In this report by <a class="link"   href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/" >The Washington Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you’ll see that many lawmakers are confused with Facebook’s basic functions. So unless the U.S. Senate creates a sole department of tech specialists, they’re likely not qualified to regulate such an advanced, ever-changing system like AI.</p><p> However, the main issue with tech companies regulating themselves is that shady corporations might abuse their power. With no intervening third party, they’re basically free to do whatever they want.</p><h2 id="End-Users"><a href="#End-Users" class="headerlink" title="End Users"></a>End Users</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mobile-chatgpt-app.jpg"                      alt="Using Mobile ChatGPT App and Placing it in Hand"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Some fear that government and private entities will abuse AI systems. They’re unsure about granting a handful of governing bodies total control over such powerful technologies, especially since AI is still evolving. They might eventually fight over authority rather than work toward efficient regulation.</p><p> To mitigate these risks, skeptics believe that end users deserve free rein to use AI models how they want. They say government bodies should only interfere when AI users break the law. It’s an ambitious goal, but it could technically be achieved if open-source AI developers dominated market shares.</p><p> That said, this setup puts non-tech-savvy individuals at a disadvantage. Users are responsible for setting the restrictions within their systems—unfortunately, not everyone has the resources to do so.</p><p> It’s also short-sighted to remove proprietary models from the market. The proliferation of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/positive-negative-impacts-open-source-ai-language-models/" >open-source AI models has several positive and negative impacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; for some, the cons outweigh the pros.</p><h2 id="Other-Entities-That-Play-a-Role-in-the-Regulation-of-AI"><a href="#Other-Entities-That-Play-a-Role-in-the-Regulation-of-AI" class="headerlink" title="Other Entities That Play a Role in the Regulation of AI"></a>Other Entities That Play a Role in the Regulation of AI</h2><p> Although major entities will spearhead the regulation of AI, there are bodies that play significant roles:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Media-Outlets"><a href="#1-Media-Outlets" class="headerlink" title="1.

Yes, tech leaders will hold more power than consumers, but various entities must cooperate to manage AI risks without impeding advancements. It’s best to set control measures now while artificial general intelligence (AGI) is still a distant goal.</p><p> That said, AI regulation is just as distant as AGI. In the meantime, users must observe safety practices to combat AI-driven threats. Good habits like limiting the people you connect with online and securing your digital PII already go a long way.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> The general public has differing views on AI—some believe machines will replace human workers altogether, while others claim AI is a fad. One thing everyone agrees on, however, is that AI needs stricter monitoring.</p><p> Despite the importance of AI regulation, it has taken a back seat to training. Developers are so obsessed with building the next biggest AI model that they’re trading cybersecurity for rapid advancement. The question isn’t if AI needs regulation; it’s which governing body with adequate funding, human resources, and technological capacity will take the initiative.</p><p> So, who should regulate AI?</p><h2 id="Government-Bodies-3"><a href="#Government-Bodies-3" class="headerlink" title="Government Bodies"></a>Government Bodies</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/government-institution-building.jpg"                      alt="White Government Institution Building With High Stairs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Various people, from consumers to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-global-tech-leaders-think-about-ai/" >tech leaders, hope the government will regulate AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Publicly funded institutions have the resources to do so. Even Elon Musk and Sam Altman, two main drivers of the AI race, believe that some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-what-dangers-does-artificial-intelligence-pose/" >privacy concerns surrounding AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are too dangerous for governing bodies to overlook.</p><p> The government should focus on protecting its constituents’ privacy and civil liberties if it takes over AI regulation. Cybercriminals keep finding ways to exploit AI systems in their schemes. Individuals not well-versed in AI might easily get fooled by synthesized voices, deepfake videos, and bot-operated online profiles.</p><p> However, one major issue with the government regulating AI is that it might inadvertently stifle innovation. AI is a complex, evolving technology. Unless the officials overseeing deployment, development, and training guidelines understand how AI works, they might make premature, inefficient judgments.</p><h2 id="AI-Developers-Tech-Companies-and-Laboratories-3"><a href="#AI-Developers-Tech-Companies-and-Laboratories-3" class="headerlink" title="AI Developers, Tech Companies, and Laboratories"></a>AI Developers, Tech Companies, and Laboratories</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/two-researchers-training-robot-arm.jpg"                      alt="Male and Female Researchers Training White Robot Arm"                ></p><p> Considering the potential roadblocks that might arise from the government monitoring AI, many would rather have tech companies spearhead regulation. They believe developers should be responsible for the tech they release. Self-regulation enables them to drive innovation and focus on advancing these systems efficiently.</p><p> Moreover, their in-depth understanding of AI will help them make fair, informed guidelines prioritizing user safety without compromising functionality. As with any technology, industry expertise streamlines monitoring. Assigning untrained officials to regulate technologies they barely understand might present more problems than benefits.</p><p> Take the 2018 U.S. Senate hearing about Facebook’s data privacy laws as an example.

All biases, privacy issues, security errors, and potential cybercrime activities stem from humans, so AI by itself isn’t something to fear.</p><p> But very few already understand how modern AI models work. Misconceptions skew people’s perception of AI, perpetuating baseless fears like AI taking over humanity or stealing jobs.</p><p> Academic institutions could fill these educational gaps through accessible resources. There aren’t too many scholarly works on modern LLMs and NLP systems yet. The public can use AI more responsibly and combat cybercrimes if they wholly understand how it works.</p><h3 id="5-Law-Enforcement-Agencies-3"><a href="#5-Law-Enforcement-Agencies-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Yes, tech leaders will hold more power than consumers, but various entities must cooperate to manage AI risks without impeding advancements. It’s best to set control measures now while artificial general intelligence (AGI) is still a distant goal.</p><p> That said, AI regulation is just as distant as AGI. In the meantime, users must observe safety practices to combat AI-driven threats. Good habits like limiting the people you connect with online and securing your digital PII already go a long way.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exploring-periscopes-world-free-access-and-user-registration/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Exploring Periscope's World  Free Access & User Registration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-elevate-engagement-enhancing-videos-with-pro-editing-skills-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate Engagement  Enhancing Videos with Pro Editing Skills for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-expert-routines-for-flawless-webinar-replays-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expert Routines for Flawless Webinar Replays for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-ig-upgrade-starts-here-top-tools-for-follower-growth/"><u>[New] IG Upgrade Starts Here  Top Tools for Follower Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-mmo-universe-guidebook-best-10-free-roleplaying-games/"><u>[New] MMO Universe Guidebook  Best 10 Free Roleplaying Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-social-syncopation-the-rhythm-of-sharing-media-on-facebook/"><u>[New] Social Syncopation  The Rhythm of Sharing Media on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-snapchat-video-feeds-from-twitter-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unveiling Snapchat Video Feeds From Twitter for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-step-by-step-on-streaming-google-meet-directly-to-youtube-channel/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Step by Step on Streaming Google Meet Directly to YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-content-creation-premier-android-editors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Content Creation  Premier Android Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-the-mystery-of-smooth-media-imports-into-windows-10/"><u>[Updated] Unlock the Mystery of Smooth Media Imports Into Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-simplicity-your-guide-to-direct-signup-buttons/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Simplicity  Your Guide to Direct Signup Buttons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-imovie-techniques-for-squaring-up-your-instagram-feed/"><u>2024 Approved  IMovie Techniques for Squaring Up Your Instagram Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premier-webcam-selections-for-dynamic-twitch-sessions/"><u>2024 Approved  Premier Webcam Selections for Dynamic Twitch Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-supreme-display-quality-top-10-ranking-of-4k-screens/"><u>2024 Approved  Supreme Display Quality  #Top 10 Ranking of 4K Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Samsung Galaxy M54 5G Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/are-there-size-constraints-on-gpt-3-responses/"><u>Are There Size Constraints on GPT-3 Responses?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/detective-your-way-join-4-virtual-ai-crime-solving-experiences/"><u>Detective Your Way: Join 4 Virtual AI Crime-Solving Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/download-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-3080-drivers-optimized-for-windows-versions-10-8-and-7/"><u>Download NVIDIA's New GeForce RTX 3080 Drivers -

From being constrained by the limits of its knowledge base to being prone to generating inaccurate information, ChatGPT needs improvement in several areas.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> However, while the AI chatbot continues to evolve and improve, there are some ChatGPT plugins that can effectively plug some of ChatGPT’s most pressing performance gaps. The Wolfram Alpha plugin is one such plugin. Here are three ways to make the most of the ChatGPT Wolfram plugin.</p><p> On March 19, 2024, <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta" >OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/" >custom GPTs and the GPT Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="1-Fact-Checking-Information"><a href="#1-Fact-Checking-Information" class="headerlink" title="1. Fact-Checking Information"></a>1. Fact-Checking Information</h2><p> One of the best use cases for the Wolfram plugin is for fact-checking content. While ChatGPT is limited by its somewhat static knowledge base and is likely to mix up facts, the Wolfram plugin is powered by a carefully curated and constantly updated database of vetted data.</p><p> This means you can run any claims in your ChatGPT-generated content against the more carefully curated Wolfram database to ensure accuracy. How can you do this?</p><p> Simply paste the text of the content you want to fact-check or provide a link to it and ask ChatGPT to invoke the Wolfram plugin to fact-check it. In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to use the plugin to fact-check some information about the solar system we copied online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fact-checking-scientific-claims-with-wolfram-plugin.jpg"                      alt="fact-checking scientific claims with Wolfram plugin"                ></p><p> After running the claims against its database, Wolfram made the following conclusions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/results-of-scientific-fact-checking.jpg"                      alt="results of scientific fact-checking"                ></p><p> As seen in the results above, the Wolfram plugin can run checks by using its own knowledge base. It is particularly useful when using ChatGPT to generate content in areas like mathematics, geography, history, chemistry, and physics.</p><p> Apart from copy-pasting text into ChatGPT, you can simply provide the plugin with links to web pages containing the text you wish to fact-check. So, instead of simply pasting the text to fact-check or asking it to fact-check a ChatGPT response, you can ask something like this:</p><p><code>The article in the URL (https://www.funkidslive.com/learn/top-10-facts/top-10-facts-about-pluto/) makes several claims about the planet Pluto, fact-check all the claims step by step.</code></p><p> To fact-check a remote resource, you’d need to activate the Link Reader plugin to pair with Wolfram. Alternatively, to fact-check a PDF, you’ll need to pair Wolfram with a PDF reader plugin. You’ll find both the Link Reader and Chat With PDF plugins on the ChatGPT plugin store.</p><h2 id="2-Solve-Complex-STEM-Problems"><a href="#2-Solve-Complex-STEM-Problems" class="headerlink" title="2. Solve Complex STEM Problems"></a>2. Solve Complex STEM Problems</h2><p> ChatGPT is considerably good at handling STEM-related problems. This is quite apparent in its mathematical abilities. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >ChatGPT still falls short in a lot of ways <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially in handling complex, unconventional mathematics problems.</p><p> One of Wolfram’s biggest selling points is its computation abilities. The Wolfram plugin will typically be able to handle a lot of the math problems that ChatGPT might have a hard time knitting together.</p><p> Also, in many cases, Wolfram can solve problems with more precision and can express the results in different formats. From line graphs to bar charts and pie charts, the Wolfram plugin can handle many more nuances of mathematics than ChatGPT can.</p><p> In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to invoke the Wolfram plugin to solve: **Given f(x) &#x3D; 3x, g(x) &#x3D; x^2-3, and h[x] &#x3D; x^3, what is the area between f(x) and g(x)**​​​​​​.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wolfram-does-maths.jpg"                      alt="The Wolfram ChatGPT plugin does math"                ></p><p> Wolfram was able to solve the problem with precision while also generating a corresponding graph. It is important to note that ChatGPT without plugins has a hard time solving this same problem and can not generate graphs.</p><p> Wolfram, on the other hand, is quite impressive in generating mathematical graphics of any kind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wolfram-plugin-creates-a-bar-chart-with-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Wolfram plugin creates a Bar chart with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Beyond mathematical graphs, Wolfram can generate infographics of different kinds. We were able to create everything from spectrograms and complex 3D plots to scatter graphs and convex hulls. For dealing with complex engineering problems that might need graphical representation, the Wolfram plugin is unrivalled.</p><p> Of course, beyond mathematics, Wolfram can outperform ChatGPT in solving a range of other STEM-related problems. From physics and chemistry to geology, astronomy, and geography, Wolfram makes ChatGPT so much better at dealing with STEM problems.</p><p> Whenever you’re dealing with problems in any of these fields, and you need your content to be as factual as possible, consider using the Wolfram plugin.</p><p> Sometimes, ChatGPT might choose not to use Wolfram for STEM questions, but for improved accuracy, you can force it to do so by explicitly requesting the chatbot to use the plugin. If you’re not sure how to set up ChatGPT plugins, here’s an explainer on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/" >how to set up and start using ChatGPT plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Data-Analysis"><a href="#3-Data-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3.

While the AI chatbot continues to iterate and improve, you can make the best of ChatGPT by taking advantage of the extra abilities that plugins bring to the table.</p><p> If you want to ameliorate the problem of inaccuracies while extending ChatGPT’s abilities to create infographics, then you should definitely try out the Wolfram plugin. But does ChatGPT work better with plugins, or when it can roam the web?</p><p> Despite being one of the best AI chatbots in the market, ChatGPT, on its own, is limited in many ways.

In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to use the plugin to fact-check some information about the solar system we copied online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fact-checking-scientific-claims-with-wolfram-plugin.jpg"                      alt="fact-checking scientific claims with Wolfram plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> After running the claims against its database, Wolfram made the following conclusions:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/results-of-scientific-fact-checking.jpg"                      alt="results of scientific fact-checking"                ></p><p> As seen in the results above, the Wolfram plugin can run checks by using its own knowledge base. It is particularly useful when using ChatGPT to generate content in areas like mathematics, geography, history, chemistry, and physics.</p><p> Apart from copy-pasting text into ChatGPT, you can simply provide the plugin with links to web pages containing the text you wish to fact-check. So, instead of simply pasting the text to fact-check or asking it to fact-check a ChatGPT response, you can ask something like this:</p><p><code>The article in the URL (https://www.funkidslive.com/learn/top-10-facts/top-10-facts-about-pluto/) makes several claims about the planet Pluto, fact-check all the claims step by step.</code></p><p> To fact-check a remote resource, you’d need to activate the Link Reader plugin to pair with Wolfram. Alternatively, to fact-check a PDF, you’ll need to pair Wolfram with a PDF reader plugin. You’ll find both the Link Reader and Chat With PDF plugins on the ChatGPT plugin store.</p><h2 id="2-Solve-Complex-STEM-Problems-3"><a href="#2-Solve-Complex-STEM-Problems-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Solve Complex STEM Problems"></a>2. Solve Complex STEM Problems</h2><p> ChatGPT is considerably good at handling STEM-related problems. This is quite apparent in its mathematical abilities. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >ChatGPT still falls short in a lot of ways <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially in handling complex, unconventional mathematics problems.</p><p> One of Wolfram’s biggest selling points is its computation abilities. The Wolfram plugin will typically be able to handle a lot of the math problems that ChatGPT might have a hard time knitting together.</p><p> Also, in many cases, Wolfram can solve problems with more precision and can express the results in different formats. From line graphs to bar charts and pie charts, the Wolfram plugin can handle many more nuances of mathematics than ChatGPT can.</p><p> In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to invoke the Wolfram plugin to solve: **Given f(x) &#x3D; 3x, g(x) &#x3D; x^2-3, and h[x] &#x3D; x^3, what is the area between f(x) and g(x)**​​​​​​.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wolfram-does-maths.jpg"                      alt="The Wolfram ChatGPT plugin does math"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Wolfram was able to solve the problem with precision while also generating a corresponding graph. It is important to note that ChatGPT without plugins has a hard time solving this same problem and can not generate graphs.</p><p> Wolfram, on the other hand, is quite impressive in generating mathematical graphics of any kind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wolfram-plugin-creates-a-bar-chart-with-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="Wolfram plugin creates a Bar chart with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Beyond mathematical graphs, Wolfram can generate infographics of different kinds. We were able to create everything from spectrograms and complex 3D plots to scatter graphs and convex hulls. For dealing with complex engineering problems that might need graphical representation, the Wolfram plugin is unrivalled.</p><p> Of course, beyond mathematics, Wolfram can outperform ChatGPT in solving a range of other STEM-related problems. From physics and chemistry to geology, astronomy, and geography, Wolfram makes ChatGPT so much better at dealing with STEM problems.</p><p> Whenever you’re dealing with problems in any of these fields, and you need your content to be as factual as possible, consider using the Wolfram plugin.</p><p> Sometimes, ChatGPT might choose not to use Wolfram for STEM questions, but for improved accuracy, you can force it to do so by explicitly requesting the chatbot to use the plugin. If you’re not sure how to set up ChatGPT plugins, here’s an explainer on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/" >how to set up and start using ChatGPT plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Data-Analysis-3"><a href="#3-Data-Analysis-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Data Analysis"></a>3. Data Analysis</h2><p> ChatGPT, especially when backed by the GPT-4 model, has quite some impressive data analysis abilities. However, the Wolfram plugin can significantly improve those abilities.</p><p> Wolfram’s ability to generate graphs of different kinds means you can analyze and summarize data in dozens and represent them in dozens of possible infographics formats without the limits of ChatGPT itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Embrace-the-Wolfram-Plugin-for-ChatGPT-3"><a href="#Embrace-the-Wolfram-Plugin-for-ChatGPT-3" class="headerlink" title="Embrace the Wolfram Plugin for ChatGPT"></a>Embrace the Wolfram Plugin for ChatGPT</h2><p> ChatGPT, despite its phenomenal abilities, is not perfect. While the AI chatbot continues to iterate and improve, you can make the best of ChatGPT by taking advantage of the extra abilities that plugins bring to the table.</p><p> If you want to ameliorate the problem of inaccuracies while extending ChatGPT’s abilities to create infographics, then you should definitely try out the Wolfram plugin. But does ChatGPT work better with plugins, or when it can roam the web?</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

While they perform similar tasks, the distinction between their language models creates varying results. You’ll trigger new responses even if you repeat your prompts.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Regardless of which tool you use more often, you’d do well to know its unique features. Here are nine notable differences between ChatGPT and Bing’s version of the bot.</p><h2 id="1-Purpose"><a href="#1-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Purpose"></a>1. Purpose</h2><p> Although both ChatGPT and Bing AI use generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models, they’re different platforms. ChatGPT is a multipurpose chatbot. It scans the vast yet limited resources from which it was trained. This includes academic journals, business websites, publications, and Wikipedia.</p><p> Meanwhile, Bing’s version of the chatbot is essentially an AI-powered search engine. The platform has more sophisticated indexing and scanning, plus the integrated AI chat feature. It acts as both a search engine and a chatbot.</p><p> Despite these nuances, ChatGPT and Bing execute similar functions. With the correct prompts, they could write essays, answer general knowledge queries, recap books, and scrutinize arguments, among other tasks. Just expect varied responses based on their trained datasets.</p><h2 id="2-Conversational-Language"><a href="#2-Conversational-Language" class="headerlink" title="2. Conversational Language"></a>2. Conversational Language</h2><p> ChatGPT and Bing both use the GPT model. This advanced natural language processing (NLP) system responds to prompts with human-like text. It answers follow-up questions, analyzes problems, and challenges non-factual statements.</p><p> Both ChatGPT and Bing’s AI can carry out conversations.

Global tech leaders need professionals who’ll talk to machines. They invest billions into the AI race—skilled, innovative prompt engineers are paid handsomely.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> If you can efficiently convey instructions, you might thrive in this industry. Here’s what you should know about prompt engineering jobs, how much they pay, and why they’re in demand.</p><h2 id="What-Do-Prompt-Engineers-Do"><a href="#What-Do-Prompt-Engineers-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Do Prompt Engineers Do?"></a>What Do Prompt Engineers Do?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/man-using-desktop-multiple-screens.jpg"                      alt="Man Using PC With Two Screens and a Laptop"                ></p><p> Prompts refer to the instructions that humans input into AI models. They could either be:</p><ul><li><strong>User-Generated Inputs:</strong> Users dictate one-time queries and tasks when interacting with AI models.</li><li><strong>Predefined Instructions:</strong> Developers set predefined rules when training AI models.</li></ul><p> AI has no inherent biases. Its output heavily depends on the prompts you feed it, assuming they fall within its pre-trained datasets.</p><p> Creating prompts doesn’t necessarily require coding skills. You can ask chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing AI general knowledge questions outright. The below photo demonstrates a brief exchange.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-general-question-about-china.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT a General Question About the Size of China"                ></p><p> Although straightforward, mastering prompt engineering is challenging. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Simple requests use basic queries, but running more complex tasks and routines demands detailed instructions.</p><p> Let’s say you’re <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/google-dialogflow-chatbot-food-delivery-build/" >building a food delivery chatbot on Google Dialogflow <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For your platform to work, you must provide clear, precise response patterns to various conversations. Ambiguous rules produce inaccurate, unhelpful dialogues.</p><p> To master prompt engineering with AI models, follow these tips.</p><h3 id="Understand-Language-Model-Architecture"><a href="#Understand-Language-Model-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Understand Language Model Architecture"></a>Understand Language Model Architecture</h3><p> Study the back-end process of different language models. Understanding how they analyze inputs will help you write accurate, detailed prompts. Maximize their respective processing capacities. Even advanced tools require external instructions to function.</p><p> Likewise, consider the limitations. Sophisticated language models pull up-to-date information from the internet, although they typically follow stricter restrictions. You’ll have to get creative with your prompts.</p><h3 id="Clearly-Express-Ambiguous-Problems"><a href="#Clearly-Express-Ambiguous-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Clearly Express Ambiguous Problems"></a>Clearly Express Ambiguous Problems</h3><p> Prompt engineers must learn to convey ambiguous, challenging problems. Not everyone can interact with AI. In fact, casual users have trouble relaying requests, especially ones that involve multi-step tasks.</p><p> You must provide as much context as possible. AI models only answer inputs. Feeding them vague prompts with unsure phrasing and generic terms will produce subpar results.</p><h3 id="Overcome-Data-Biases"><a href="#Overcome-Data-Biases" class="headerlink" title="Overcome Data Biases"></a>Overcome Data Biases</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-limitations-of-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Disclaimers About Its Limitations and Capabilities"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> AI models are inherently impartial.

You’ll notice the impact of seemingly minute changes as you create more detailed, precise instructions. Don’t let errors discourage you.</p><p> Instead of obsessing over writing flawless prompts in one go, get comfortable with A&#x2F;B testing. Prompt engineering requires much trial and error. Relentlessly edit formulas until you find the right tone, phrasing, and terms to convey instructions.</p><h3 id="Study-Industry-Trends"><a href="#Study-Industry-Trends" class="headerlink" title="Study Industry Trends"></a>Study Industry Trends</h3><p> Prompt engineers should stay up to date with the current industry trends. AI’s fast-paced evolution makes specialization impractical. New technologies can quickly dominate popular ones, so don’t just focus on one AI model.</p><p> Take the competition between different AI platforms as an example. While ChatGPT made waves with GPT-3.5, other companies like Microsoft also developed their own powerful language models, such as Bing AI. Meanwhile, OpenAI continued to innovate and <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/best-new-gpt4-features-explained/" >released GPT-4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a more advanced language model.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Do-Prompt-Engineers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Prompt-Engineers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Prompt Engineers Make?"></a>How Much Do Prompt Engineers Make?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bank-check-amount.jpg"                      alt="Sample Bank Check With 584 XXX USD"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Prompt engineering is still new, yet employers already understand its relevance. <a class="link"   href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3" >Bloomberg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> says the average prompt engineering salary ranges from $175,000 to $335,000 per annum. Considering the ease of entry, you might doubt this estimate. Anyone can talk to AI, after all. Even someone with no tech background can write effective AI prompts.</p><p> However, don’t confuse basic with advanced prompt engineering. Basic prompt engineering involves standard tasks, while advanced prompt engineering involves complex routines and training processes.</p><p> Advanced prompts often contain thousands of carefully chosen words.

But an increasing number of AI-based apps promise to help alleviate mental health troubles and even act as virtual therapists.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p><strong>Important:</strong> These apps are not replacements for mental health professionals, and if you are in distress, it’s best to seek help. These apps offer temporary or base-level methods to tackle negative thoughts and get you through a bad mood.</p><h2 id="1-Thought-Coach"><a href="#1-Thought-Coach" class="headerlink" title="1.

These are irrational, exaggerated, or unhelpful thought patterns that cloud our view of situations. But AI is surprisingly good at identifying these cognitive distortions, as we have seen while exploring <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/overcome-stress-with-chatgpt/" >how to overcome stress with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Thought Coach uses this ability to help you reframe and rephrase your thoughts. The algorithm is trained on common cognitive distortions, such as overgeneralization, all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, jumping to conclusions, mind reading, etc. When you’re ready to start, type in all the details about the event that led to your negative emotions and thoughts. Then, in the next box, add all the negative thoughts you’re experiencing about it.</p><p> After processing the data, Thought Coach will show you an analysis of the cognitive distortions it has observed in your statements. It highlights sentences in your initial input and gives examples of what was reality and what you took away from it. It’s simple and effective when you want to search the internet for advice.</p><h2 id="2-SommerAI"><a href="#2-SommerAI" class="headerlink" title="2. SommerAI"></a>2.

Solution-focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is a short-term, goal-oriented therapeutic process where instead of identifying causes for the current problem, the objective is to find solutions in actionable and practical ways. Sommer uses NASA’s psychological research on these two methods to create a trained ChatGPT-like therapist.</p><p> After logging in with your Google account, you’ll have to pick which type of therapy you want to try. Then, start a new chat and answer the questions that SommerAI asks. The more detailed and communicative you are, the better the bot responds. Your chats are saved in your account, so when you revisit it later, you can choose to start a new chat for a new topic or revisit that topic and take the conversation further; in the latter, the AI should perform better as it has more data from the past chat.</p><p> Apart from these two main chat therapy bots, SommerAI also offers <strong>Healthy Nuggets</strong>. These small actions, habits, or exercises will boost your mental health.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Mindsum-Bot"><a href="#3-Mindsum-Bot" class="headerlink" title="3.

It has recently created an AI chatbot called Mindsum Bot, which can give anyone the correct information about any mental health questions and guide them in seeking professional help.</p><p> Mindsum says the bot was built on GPT technology and layered with their own AI models. It is trained on three evidence-based clinically-tested therapeutic practices: CBT, IPT, and DBT. Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) is a short-term depression treatment focusing on social interactions. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a modified type of CBT that teaches how to regulate emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and be more mindful.</p><p> This training and backing of an established mental health organization makes Mindsum Bot much more reliable than other therapy chatbots. It’s not restricted to UK users, as anyone worldwide can use it.

It uses casual language and reframes what you've written while offering empathy and asking a question that could take you to the next step in resolving the situation. The whole process makes it feel like you're talking to a friend.<p> JungGPT has been trained on several texts and a language model that facilitates emotional understanding. The makers at Ventura UX are quick to point this out. “While JungGPT does have a ‘form’ of empathy, it does not feel empathy itself, but understands it based on its training to do so and through analyzing text in different context.”</p><p> When we signed up and tested JungGPT, it was as simple as using any ChatGPT-like AI chatbot. The site notes that the free plan has limited messaging, but we didn’t hit those restrictions in our usage. The premium plan costs $7 per month for unlimited messaging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Lotus"><a href="#5-Lotus" class="headerlink" title="5.

However, as massive players like Google and Bing integrate ChatGPT-like AI chatbots within their search engines, how you interact with these services will change drastically.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> AI-powered search engines will significantly impact how you find and consume content online and the future of websites. While this is still a gray area, this article will explore one of several potential ways AI chatbot-driven search engines could affect independent websites.</p><h2 id="How-Traditional-Search-Engines-Work"><a href="#How-Traditional-Search-Engines-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Traditional Search Engines Work"></a>How Traditional Search Engines Work</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-search-engine.jpg"                      alt="Google&#39;s search page"                ></p><p> Whenever you search for something online through a search engine like Google or Bing, complex bots crawl through millions of web pages to generate the most relevant results for your query. Once this happens, you can click any link on the search engine results page (SERP) and be redirected to the website providing the information.</p><p> The more users visit a specific website, the more visibility, traffic, and revenue it can generate using advertising and affiliate marketing strategies, among others. This is why businesses invest in search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to ensure their websites rank on the first page of results—allowing them to get more visibility and revenue.</p><h2 id="How-Generative-AI-Search-Could-Impact-Website-Visibility-Traffic-and-Revenue"><a href="#How-Generative-AI-Search-Could-Impact-Website-Visibility-Traffic-and-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="How Generative AI Search Could Impact Website Visibility, Traffic, and Revenue"></a>How Generative AI Search Could Impact Website Visibility, Traffic, and Revenue</h2><p> AI chatbots like ChatGPT can generate human-like conversations and provide personalized answers to users. It’s no wonder <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-bing-gets-chatgpt-ai/" >Microsoft has integrated this technology into Bing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/google-launching-bard-ai-compete-with-chatgpt/" >Google is launching its AI chatbot called Bard to stay competitive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the market. Other search engines like <a class="link"   href="http://you.com/" >you.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://neeva.com/" >Neeva AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have also integrated AI chatbots in their search engines to provide more customized responses to users.</p><p> So, how does this new approach work?</p><p> Let’s say you visit <strong>bing.com</strong> to find the best smart TV to buy in 2023. In addition to displaying a list of relevant links you can click on to find the information you need, Bing’s chatbot can also sift through the webpages related to the query and provide personalized and human-like conversational responses with links for further reading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bing-ai-search.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI search"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bing-chatbot-ai.jpg"                      alt="Bing AI generative search"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bing-search-ai.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Bing search"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> So, instead of manually going through multiple websites to find the information you’re looking for, you can save time by getting more personalized responses from the AI chatbot. In addition, you can ask follow-up questions for more precision and specificity. For example, you could ask the chatbot to narrow your search to TVs within a specific price range or those with gaming features. From here, you can head straight to Amazon to buy the product.</p><p> Although these chatbot responses also include links to (their sources) other websites providing TV reviews, we can predict that some users will skip this step and ask follow-up questions instead or head straight to purchase the product. This is similar to featured snippets on search engine results pages, which provide instant answers, for instance, someone’s age, without having to click through to the website providing the information.</p><p> The above could lead to fewer website visits, less traffic, and, thus, decreased revenue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/google-snippet-search.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot showing Google snippet"                ></p><h2 id="The-Potential-Implications-of-AI-Powered-Search-Engines"><a href="#The-Potential-Implications-of-AI-Powered-Search-Engines" class="headerlink" title="The Potential Implications of AI-Powered Search Engines"></a>The Potential Implications of AI-Powered Search Engines</h2><p> Although it is still too early to know precisely how generative AI search will change websites, there are a few potential implications we can anticipate. Considering the traditional search model basically works by trading traffic for free content, online publications struggling with decreased web traffic may suffer from lower advertising revenue and find it harder to stay afloat.</p><p> Smaller or mid-sized independent websites with less revenue may be the first to be impacted and may become obsolete as these AI chatbots become better at providing personalized answers. Larger publications, on the other hand, may have more resources to come up with new SEO strategies or different innovative approaches to boost their website traffic.</p><p> Some online publications might have to rely on AI content generators to write their articles, as they are cheaper and can churn out content faster than humans. This could lead to more bland, unauthentic, and low-quality content on the internet, as <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-chatgpt-wont-take-writing-job/" >ChatGPT-like tools aren’t good enough to replace skilled writers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Case-for-Human-Written-Content"><a href="#The-Case-for-Human-Written-Content" class="headerlink" title="The Case for Human-Written Content"></a>The Case for Human-Written Content</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/human-content-writer.jpg"                      alt="A woman using her computer"                ></p><p> Large language models like ChatGPT rely on vast text databases to generate coherent and plausible-sounding responses.

Combine that with OpenAI’s already free ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo, and you’ll have both tools without paying a cent!</p><p> A monthly GitHub Copilot subscription and the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 should provide enough assistance for both personal and professional projects. If you still feel like you need that slight edge, then shelling out extra for <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-chatgpt-plugins/" >useful ChatGPT plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may also be worth the investment.</p><h2 id="There-Are-Alternatives"><a href="#There-Are-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="There Are Alternatives"></a>There Are Alternatives</h2><p> Though GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have become the most popular AI tools used in software development, there are also alternatives worth exploring. For code completion and generation, tools like TabNine and Codeium offer similar functionality to GitHub Copilot.</p><p> Aside from Claude AI, there are no really good alternatives to ChatGPT unless you want to spend time setting up a local chatbot. In that case, you may be interested in chatbots like GPT4All, Nvidia Chat with RTX, and the various BERT models using TextGen WebUI.</p></article<ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-4-Bungles-That-Impact-Content-Quality-via-ChatGPT"><a href="#The-4-Bungles-That-Impact-Content-Quality-via-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="The 4 Bungles That Impact Content Quality via ChatGPT"></a>The 4 Bungles That Impact Content Quality via ChatGPT</h2><p> ChatGPT’s ability to generate content in a fraction of the time has made it increasingly popular with content creators. However, like any powerful technology, AI language models can be misused.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Before you take this issue lightly, know that misusing AI can lead to legal issues, reputational damage, and erroneous output. Let’s explore the wrong ways content creators use ChatGPT so that you can avoid these problems.</p><h2 id="1-Don’t-Overdepend-on-ChatGPT"><a href="#1-Don’t-Overdepend-on-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Overdepend on ChatGPT"></a>1. Don’t Overdepend on ChatGPT</h2><p> Imagine you’re a first-time ChatGPT user. Since it’s your first time using it, you’ll find its speed remarkable. What once took you hours to create only takes seconds. As time goes by, you might start heavily relying on it. You make a few edits but don’t bother to research.</p><p> This phenomenon is what you call overdependence on AI, and it’s a tempting path to take for creators who are pushed to produce output rapidly. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2022/06/Aether-Overreliance-on-AI-Review-Final-6.21.22.pdf" >Microsoft’s literature review on AI overreliance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> warns that overdepending on AI leads you to accept erroneous results.</p><p> Take the CNET controversy as an example. CNET published financial explainer articles written by AI under the unassuming byline “CNET Money Staff.” Unfortunately for CNET, <a class="link"   href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai" >Futurism <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> spotted glaring errors in the AI-generated articles. It called out the media outfit for publishing horrible financial advice and mass-producing cheap content to manipulate Google search results for profit.</p><p> We don’t know if CNET suffered from overdependence on AI or overconfidence that nobody would notice. Regardless, the incident should serve as a warning to not over-rely on AI’s glib output.</p><p> Remember that it’s possible for ChatGPT to churn out outdated information. As ChatGPT itself says, its knowledge cutoff is only up to September 2021, so it’s always good to double-check the information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-50.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT reminds user to double check information it provides"                ></p><p> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also mentions in an <a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=540vzMlf-54" >ABC News video interview <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that users should be more cautious about ChatGPT’s “hallucinations problem.” It can confidently state made-up ideas as if they were facts. A single incident like CNET’s can damage your credibility as an authoritative source.</p><p> It’s easy to blindly accept ChatGPT’s output when you don’t have enough knowledge to evaluate the results. Moreover, you might not bother to check a different point of view when ChatGPT’s answers align with your beliefs. To avoid these embarrassing situations, fact-check, seek multiple perspectives, and get expert advice.</p><p> If you’re learning to use ChatGPT for content creation, include <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/" >what AI hallucination is and how you can spot it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your list of topics to master. More importantly, don’t disregard human judgment and creativity. Remember, AI should augment your thinking and not replace it.</p><h2 id="2-Don’t-Ask-ChatGPT-for-Research-Links"><a href="#2-Don’t-Ask-ChatGPT-for-Research-Links" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Ask ChatGPT for Research Links"></a>2. Don’t Ask ChatGPT for Research Links</h2><p> You’d likely be disappointed if you asked ChatGPT for internet links to research sources. ChatGPT will give you links, but they will be the wrong ones or not necessarily the best ones on the web.</p><p> To test, we asked ChatGPT to give us JSTOR research paper links on British young adult fantasy writers who have written coming-of-age stories. The AI gave us five resources with titles, volume numbers, page numbers, and authors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-46.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT giving JSTOR links to wrong resources"                ></p><p> At first glance, the list looks credible. The JSTOR articles have impressive-sounding titles like “Constructing Hybrid Identity: Race and Nation in Sally Green’s Half Bad Trilogy.” But a Google search would quickly show that most links lead to the wrong JSTOR articles. One of the links led to a 404 landing page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-47.jpg"                      alt="chatGPT giving a link to a nonexistent JSTOR academic journal"                ></p><p> In another example, we gave ChatGPT a more specific topic to research on to see if it would come up with better results. This is the prompt we used: I am writing a literary research paper on “The Heroine in British Young Adult and Coming-of-Age Contemporary Novels.” Can you give me a literature review on this topic?</p><p> ChatGPT responded with a list of five works, complete with the author’s names and summaries. However, we couldn’t find any of the works it listed online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-49-1.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT responding to request for a literature review"                ></p><p> To better understand the information, we asked for links. This time, ChatGPT refused, saying it was only an AI language model without web browsing capabilities. However, it gave bibliographic information, which we couldn’t verify online despite the works being supposedly written between 2004-2018.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-48.jpg"                      alt="chatGPT giving bibliographic information to articles not found online"                ></p><p> When prompted to give links to verify the information it provided, ChatGPT flatly refused this time. It said it didn’t have web browsing capabilities and instead gave a list of bibliographic information. However, the data was still erroneous.</p><p> The latest <a class="link"   href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes" >ChatGPT release notes on OpenAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> show it now has web browsing capabilities. But these features have yet to be rolled out to every user. Also, as <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/openai-connects-chatgpt-to-the-internet/" >TechCrunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> points out, ChatGPT’s results aren’t necessarily the best on the internet since professionals can game search engine results.</p><p> To avoid this problem:</p><ul><li>Use more appropriate online resources for your research.</li><li>If you need sources for academic research, check <a class="link"   href="https://scholar.google.com/" >Google Scholar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://elicit.org/" >Elicit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an AI research assistant.</li><li>Remember to critically assess the results and exercise judgment when selecting which ones to cite.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Don’t-Replace-Workplace-Connections-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#3-Don’t-Replace-Workplace-Connections-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Replace Workplace Connections With ChatGPT"></a>3. Don’t Replace Workplace Connections With ChatGPT</h2><p> Some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things that you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might tempt you to anthropomorphize it or give it human attributes. For instance, you can ask ChatGPT for advice and chat with it if you need someone to talk to.</p><p> In this example below, we told it to act as our best friend for ten years and give us advice on workplace burnout, and it seemed to listen and empathize:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/muo-photo-standard-45.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT giving advice on workplace burnout"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> But no matter how compassionate it sounds, ChatGPT isn’t human. What sounds like human-generated sentences are only the results of ChatGPT predicting the next word or “token” in the sequence based on its training data. It isn’t a sentient being with a will and mind of its own as you do.</p><p> That said, ChatGPT can’t substitute for human relationships and collaboration in the workplace. As the <a class="link"   href="https://workwellbeinginitiative.org/module-4-moderating-work-demands#:~:text=The%20evidence%20shows%20that%20positive,harmful%20effects%20of%20workplace%20stress.&text=Positive%20relationships%20at%20work%20are%20also%20good%20for%20the%20bottom%20line." >Work and Well-being Initiative at Harvard University <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> says, these human connections benefit you, helping improve your well-being and protecting you against workplace stress.</p><p> Learning to work with the latest tech tools is important, but interacting with your team is also essential. Instead of relying on ChatGPT to replicate social connections, build your interrelational skills, interact with co-workers, and find the best people you can work with.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Don’t-Feed-ChatGPT-Ineffective-Prompts"><a href="#4-Don’t-Feed-ChatGPT-Ineffective-Prompts" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Feed ChatGPT Ineffective Prompts"></a>4. Don’t Feed ChatGPT Ineffective Prompts</h2><p> Are you finding it hard to get the best responses out of ChatGPT when creating content? Providing context and giving precise instructions should solve your problem.</p><p> In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to help us summarize an interesting blog by Eric Allen on <a class="link"   href="https://hackernoon.com/ai-prompts-are-the-incantations-that-make-chatgpt-do-magical-things" >Hackernoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The lengthy article describes Allen’s process of refining AI prompts in ChatGPT to create a music recommendation system called BeatBrain.</p><p> However, ChatGPT wasn’t familiar with Allen’s article. When we shared the link and asked it to summarize, ChatGPT hallucinated.

The UBS research compared web application traffic data for apps launched in the last 20 years to the traffic at ChatGPT’s official web address <a class="link"   href="http://chat.openai.com/" >chat.openai.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The data showed that ChatGPT had around 25 million daily visits, of which 13 million were unique (i.e., from different visitors).</p><p> Altogether, the research points out that ChatGPT has around 100 million users just 2.5 months after its launch. To understand how impressive those numbers are, it took Facebook 4.5 years, WhatsApp 3.5 years, Instagram 2.5 years, and Google almost a year to reach 100 million users. In addition, just five days after its launch, ChatGPT had its first one million users, a milestone that took Twitter nearly two years to achieve.</p><p> However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-twitter-alternatives-struggling-to-succeed/" >the release and meteoric rise of the Meta-owned Threads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> microblogging platform challenges this narrative. Threads by Meta gained around 100 million users in less than a week. Such a number is unprecedented in internet history, even surpassing that of ChatGPT. But there’s an interesting caveat.</p><p> While Threads may have surpassed ChatGPT in terms of raw user growth numbers, ChatGPT’s growth is more impressive and purely organic. ChatGPT had to attract users and build awareness from scratch, with no existing platform to leverage. Threads, on the other hand, gained an instant boost by integrating with Instagram right off the bat, giving it access to Instagram’s vast existing user base of over one billion monthly active users.</p><p> While both growth trajectories are undoubtedly impressive, ChatGPT captured the public’s attention and compelled 100 million sign-ups in a short time, completely on its own merits as a novel AI chatbot. In contrast, Threads was able to piggyback off Instagram’s dominant platform and users from day one, giving it an artificial head start over ChatGPT’s more organic viral success.</p><p> So, how exactly did ChatGPT achieve such an enormous feat?</p><h2 id="The-3-Reasons-Behind-ChatGPT’s-Explosive-Growth"><a href="#The-3-Reasons-Behind-ChatGPT’s-Explosive-Growth" class="headerlink" title="The 3 Reasons Behind ChatGPT’s Explosive Growth"></a>The 3 Reasons Behind ChatGPT’s Explosive Growth</h2><p> Wondering what helped ChatGPT achieve such unparalleled growth?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Timing-of-the-AI-Wave"><a href="#1-Timing-of-the-AI-Wave" class="headerlink" title="1.

AI had always been something that was relegated to the future—a subject of speculation for most of the internet-savvy public. 2022 saw AI go mainstream in a way never seen before, with advances like DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and other generative AI tools. People were primed and excited about AI, so when ChatGPT came along with a friendly interface anyone could use, it captured people’s imagination perfectly.

ChatGPT Is Versatile and Incredibly Useful<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/surface-laptop-go-successor-featured.jpg"                      alt="People using a laptop"                ></p><p> Two of the most important factors behind ChatGPT’s explosive growth are its usefulness and versatility. OpenAI was not just able to create technology people wanted to use; they created something that almost everyone could find useful.</p><p> Think of it. When Facebook first launched, it was targeted primarily at university students, especially those who wanted to get to know each other. However, not everyone on campus wants to know who lives next door. Consequently, this meant a limited user base and limited usefulness at the time. Similarly, when Spotify came along, it targeted people who wanted to stream music online. Limitation? Well, not everyone wants to stream music.</p><p> On the other hand, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-questions-and-answers/" >ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is targeted at no one in particular.

The UBS research compared web application traffic data for apps launched in the last 20 years to the traffic at ChatGPT’s official web address <a class="link"   href="http://chat.openai.com/" >chat.openai.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The data showed that ChatGPT had around 25 million daily visits, of which 13 million were unique (i.e., from different visitors).</p><p> Altogether, the research points out that ChatGPT has around 100 million users just 2.5 months after its launch. To understand how impressive those numbers are, it took Facebook 4.5 years, WhatsApp 3.5 years, Instagram 2.5 years, and Google almost a year to reach 100 million users. In addition, just five days after its launch, ChatGPT had its first one million users, a milestone that took Twitter nearly two years to achieve.</p><p> However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-twitter-alternatives-struggling-to-succeed/" >the release and meteoric rise of the Meta-owned Threads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> microblogging platform challenges this narrative. Threads by Meta gained around 100 million users in less than a week. Such a number is unprecedented in internet history, even surpassing that of ChatGPT. But there’s an interesting caveat.</p><p> While Threads may have surpassed ChatGPT in terms of raw user growth numbers, ChatGPT’s growth is more impressive and purely organic. ChatGPT had to attract users and build awareness from scratch, with no existing platform to leverage. Threads, on the other hand, gained an instant boost by integrating with Instagram right off the bat, giving it access to Instagram’s vast existing user base of over one billion monthly active users.</p><p> While both growth trajectories are undoubtedly impressive, ChatGPT captured the public’s attention and compelled 100 million sign-ups in a short time, completely on its own merits as a novel AI chatbot. In contrast, Threads was able to piggyback off Instagram’s dominant platform and users from day one, giving it an artificial head start over ChatGPT’s more organic viral success.</p><p> So, how exactly did ChatGPT achieve such an enormous feat?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35038891&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.dupinout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DupInOut-New-Duplicate-Scan-Tab.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-3-Reasons-Behind-ChatGPT’s-Explosive-Growth-1"><a href="#The-3-Reasons-Behind-ChatGPT’s-Explosive-Growth-1" class="headerlink" title="The 3 Reasons Behind ChatGPT’s Explosive Growth"></a>The 3 Reasons Behind ChatGPT’s Explosive Growth</h2><p> Wondering what helped ChatGPT achieve such unparalleled growth?</p><h3 id="1-Timing-of-the-AI-Wave-1"><a href="#1-Timing-of-the-AI-Wave-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

OpenAI was not just able to create technology people wanted to use; they created something that almost everyone could find useful.</p><p> Think of it. When Facebook first launched, it was targeted primarily at university students, especially those who wanted to get to know each other. However, not everyone on campus wants to know who lives next door. Consequently, this meant a limited user base and limited usefulness at the time. Similarly, when Spotify came along, it targeted people who wanted to stream music online. Limitation? Well, not everyone wants to stream music.</p><p> On the other hand, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-questions-and-answers/" >ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is targeted at no one in particular. So, irrespective of what you do, you’ll find <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >different uses for ChatGPT in your day-to-day life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Teachers, students, engineers, legal practitioners, programmers, writers, CEOs—everyone. Being useful to everyone is a tremendous advantage very few apps can boast of, even years into their existence.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-ChatGPT-Is-Free-and-Easy-to-Use-2"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Is-Free-and-Easy-to-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

ChatGPT does not have problems in any of these areas.</p><p> While many people might not be aware, ChatGPT is not the first of its kind nor the most sophisticated AI text generator available. OpenAI’s other AI text generator tool, available at the GPT Playground, is much more powerful and has existed long before ChatGPT went viral.</p><p> However, what makes ChatGPT different from the rest is its ease of use, accessibility, and zero cost to the user. Although <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-launches-premium-chatgpt-subscription-service/" >ChatGPT Plus, a paid version of ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, was released on February 3, 2023, ChatGPT’s free access model pushed ChatGPT to millions in just days.</p><p> On top of this, ChatGPT is incredibly easy to access. With a phone number and an email, anyone can sign up for an account from their browser, and that’s just about what you need to start using ChatGPT. Similar AI tools from other companies are either accessible to a very select audience or require a lengthy waitlist.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-ChatGPT-Is-Heavily-Community-Driven-2"><a href="#4-ChatGPT-Is-Heavily-Community-Driven-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

The growth of most of today’s popular web apps can be attributed to extensive ad campaigns. On the contrary, ChatGPT’s growth has mostly been powered by everyday users sharing their experiences with their community.</p><p> From social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to people sharing their ChatGPT experience on personal blogs, ChatGPT’s growth has been primarily pushed by testimonials of people who have used the AI chatbot. Ad campaigns can be effective when done properly, but nothing beats the effectiveness of recommendations and testimonials from trusted people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Appeal-to-Human-Imagination-2"><a href="#5-Appeal-to-Human-Imagination-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

The timing aligned it with the tech climate.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-ChatGPT-Is-Versatile-and-Incredibly-Useful-2"><a href="#2-ChatGPT-Is-Versatile-and-Incredibly-Useful-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

OpenAI was not just able to create technology people wanted to use; they created something that almost everyone could find useful.</p><p> Think of it. When Facebook first launched, it was targeted primarily at university students, especially those who wanted to get to know each other. However, not everyone on campus wants to know who lives next door. Consequently, this meant a limited user base and limited usefulness at the time. Similarly, when Spotify came along, it targeted people who wanted to stream music online. Limitation? Well, not everyone wants to stream music.</p><p> On the other hand, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-questions-and-answers/" >ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is targeted at no one in particular. So, irrespective of what you do, you’ll find <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >different uses for ChatGPT in your day-to-day life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Teachers, students, engineers, legal practitioners, programmers, writers, CEOs—everyone. Being useful to everyone is a tremendous advantage very few apps can boast of, even years into their existence.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-ChatGPT-Is-Free-and-Easy-to-Use-3"><a href="#3-ChatGPT-Is-Free-and-Easy-to-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

ChatGPT does not have problems in any of these areas.</p><p> While many people might not be aware, ChatGPT is not the first of its kind nor the most sophisticated AI text generator available. OpenAI’s other AI text generator tool, available at the GPT Playground, is much more powerful and has existed long before ChatGPT went viral.</p><p> However, what makes ChatGPT different from the rest is its ease of use, accessibility, and zero cost to the user. Although <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-launches-premium-chatgpt-subscription-service/" >ChatGPT Plus, a paid version of ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, was released on February 3, 2023, ChatGPT’s free access model pushed ChatGPT to millions in just days.</p><p> On top of this, ChatGPT is incredibly easy to access. With a phone number and an email, anyone can sign up for an account from their browser, and that’s just about what you need to start using ChatGPT. Similar AI tools from other companies are either accessible to a very select audience or require a lengthy waitlist.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-ChatGPT-Is-Heavily-Community-Driven-3"><a href="#4-ChatGPT-Is-Heavily-Community-Driven-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

The growth of most of today’s popular web apps can be attributed to extensive ad campaigns. On the contrary, ChatGPT’s growth has mostly been powered by everyday users sharing their experiences with their community.</p><p> From social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to people sharing their ChatGPT experience on personal blogs, ChatGPT’s growth has been primarily pushed by testimonials of people who have used the AI chatbot. Ad campaigns can be effective when done properly, but nothing beats the effectiveness of recommendations and testimonials from trusted people.</p><h3 id="5-Appeal-to-Human-Imagination-3"><a href="#5-Appeal-to-Human-Imagination-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It gave an accessible glimpse into an AI-powered future. The idea of having an AI assistant you can chat with naturally was instantly exciting and captured imaginations in a way no other consumer AI application had quite achieved before. This vision of the future drew people in.</p><h2 id="Does-ChatGPT-Have-Room-for-More-Rapid-Growth-3"><a href="#Does-ChatGPT-Have-Room-for-More-Rapid-Growth-3" class="headerlink" title="Does ChatGPT Have Room for More Rapid Growth?"></a>Does ChatGPT Have Room for More Rapid Growth?</h2><p> Though ChatGPT’s meteoric growth has started to slow down recently, the product still shows tremendous potential for further adoption.

Many institutions even banned ChatGPT altogether.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> While it’s reasonable for educators to feel threatened by AI tools, please note that they also yield several advantages. It’s hasty and careless to ban AI. Here are some ways how students and teachers could benefit from AI tools.</p><h2 id="1-AI-Detects-AI-Generated-Text"><a href="#1-AI-Detects-AI-Generated-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.

Even if AI sites are blocked on campus networks, students can access them on their gadgets. They’ll still cheat on their homework.</p><p> Instead of attempting to stop students from using AI tools like ChatGPT, educators should find ways to spot AI-generated content efficiently. Consider using <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/accurate-ai-text-detectors/" >AI text detectors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Advanced AI models like GPT-4, which powers chatbots like <a class="link"   href="http://www.bing.com/" >Bing Chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and ChatGPT Plus, produce natural, human-like text that’s almost indistinguishable.</p><p> Yes, AI text detectors are still flawed. But widely trusted options like <a class="link"   href="https://gptzero.me/" >GPTZero <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier" >OpenAI’s Text Classifier <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> demonstrate relatively reliable results. You can at least use them to detect possible cheaters. Only quiz students yourself if their paper seems suspicious; that way, you don’t have to investigate everyone taking your classes.</p><h2 id="2-Text-To-Image-Generators-Spark-Creativity"><a href="#2-Text-To-Image-Generators-Spark-Creativity" class="headerlink" title="2.

They feel that using text-to-image tools is the equivalent of tracing another person’s artwork. After all, AI pulls elements from existing images. Since <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/copyright-rules-ai-art/" >copyright protection laws don’t apply to AI-generated images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can’t claim ownership. Using them in commercial applications has legal consequences.</p><p> With that said, students can still use AI art as inspiration. They should treat art generators like Google or Pinterest. Ask them to generate whatever concept they’re struggling to visualize—see how AI approaches it.</p><p> Apart from sparking creativity, art generators can help students play around with different art styles. Indeed, most artists have a specialty. But exploring various techniques gives them deeper insights into other art forms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Chatbots-Help-Students-With-Research"><a href="#3-Chatbots-Help-Students-With-Research" class="headerlink" title="3. Chatbots Help Students With Research"></a>3. Chatbots Help Students With Research</h2><p> While students should never submit AI-generated content as is, there’s nothing wrong with reading them. Chatbots streamline research. They provide condensed, straightforward outputs comprising details from widely known and trusted resources.</p><p> Just make sure your students understand AI biases. Chatbots don’t verify information—they present numbers, data, and claims from their datasets. As a result, erroneous outputs might occasionally arise.</p><p> The best approach is to use chatbots at the start of the research process. Have them simplify topics first. Otherwise, students might have trouble following more complex journals, academic papers, and scholarly databases.</p><p> Consider using Bing instead of ChatGPT for research. Bing Chat lists its sources, making it easier to double-check the information presented.</p><h2 id="4-AI-Tools-Automate-Work-Tasks"><a href="#4-AI-Tools-Automate-Work-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="4. AI Tools Automate Work Tasks"></a>4. AI Tools Automate Work Tasks</h2><p> Educators should stop telling students to avoid offloading tasks. Automation isn’t bad. On the contrary, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apps-to-automate-repetitive-tasks/" >automating repetitive, tedious tasks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gives them more time for complex, demanding projects.</p><p> Take essay writing as an example. While students shouldn’t publish AI-generated content, AI can help create article outlines and research topics. The extra time lets them focus on writing and editing.</p><p> Determining what tasks to automate can confuse first-timers, so educators should guide their students. Explain the most common ethical dilemmas in AI. Ensure they understand the limitations and capabilities of AI systems so that they can make informed, moral decisions.</p><h2 id="5-Chatbots-Give-Teachers-Third-Party-Insights"><a href="#5-Chatbots-Give-Teachers-Third-Party-Insights" class="headerlink" title="5.

Many people have trouble reading the thoughts, emotions, and desires of someone younger than them. Cultural generation gaps are hard to overcome.</p><p> Although empathy is innate, you can practice it online by conversing with chatbots. Ask AI to portray different personas. The below image shows how ChatGPT would illustrate a 20-year-old male college student whose personal problems are interfering with school.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-roleplaying-as-college-kid.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Roleplaying as Jeff a 20 year old College Kid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

Using AI Still Requires Critical Thinking"></a>6. Using AI Still Requires Critical Thinking</h2><p> Teach students the constraints of AI. Rather than asking them to avoid these systems, show them how critical thinking overcomes errors and inaccuracies. Emphasize that AI’s just another tool.</p><p> AI systems have varying capabilities. Advanced models produce more human-like text and life-like photos, but older models might perform comparatively worse.</p><p> Take chatbots as an example. Bing Chat uses a GPT-4 model, while ChatGPT runs on a GPT-3.5 model; the former often provides more reliable, accurate information. Explain these limitations. Encourage your students to use their critical thinking skills and objectively analyze which AI systems best suit them.</p><h2 id="7-AI-Based-Video-Enhancement-Improves-Digital-Classrooms"><a href="#7-AI-Based-Video-Enhancement-Improves-Digital-Classrooms" class="headerlink" title="7.

Educators use pre-recorded assets to demonstrate complex topics that might be challenging to explain verbally. You’ll find them in digital and in-person classes alike.</p><p> Despite the importance of these assets, not many classes get quality presentations. Crafting them requires expensive resources. Educators rarely have the skills, time, and equipment to produce high-definition videos alone.</p><p> To resolve this issue, schools should equip lecturers and professors with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/video-quality-enhancers/" >AI-driven video enhancers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
