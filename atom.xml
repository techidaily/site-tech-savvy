But an increasing number of AI-based apps promise to help alleviate mental health troubles and even act as virtual therapists.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p><strong>Important:</strong> These apps are not replacements for mental health professionals, and if you are in distress, it’s best to seek help. These apps offer temporary or base-level methods to tackle negative thoughts and get you through a bad mood.</p><h2 id="1-Thought-Coach"><a href="#1-Thought-Coach" class="headerlink" title="1. Thought Coach"></a>1. Thought Coach</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/best-online-ai-chatgpt-chat-bot-therapists-mental-health-thought-coach.jpg"                      alt="Thought Coach uses ChatGPT AI to identify cognitive distortions in your statements and emotions, to overcome your irrationality"                ></p><p> Cognitive distortions are among the most common psychological issues that many of us have to tackle regularly. These are irrational, exaggerated, or unhelpful thought patterns that cloud our view of situations. But AI is surprisingly good at identifying these cognitive distortions, as we have seen while exploring <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/overcome-stress-with-chatgpt/" >how to overcome stress with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Thought Coach uses this ability to help you reframe and rephrase your thoughts. The algorithm is trained on common cognitive distortions, such as overgeneralization, all-or-nothing thinking, emotional reasoning, jumping to conclusions, mind reading, etc. When you’re ready to start, type in all the details about the event that led to your negative emotions and thoughts. Then, in the next box, add all the negative thoughts you’re experiencing about it.</p><p> After processing the data, Thought Coach will show you an analysis of the cognitive distortions it has observed in your statements. It highlights sentences in your initial input and gives examples of what was reality and what you took away from it. It’s simple and effective when you want to search the internet for advice.</p><h2 id="2-SommerAI"><a href="#2-SommerAI" class="headerlink" title="2. SommerAI"></a>2.

Solution-focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is a short-term, goal-oriented therapeutic process where instead of identifying causes for the current problem, the objective is to find solutions in actionable and practical ways. Sommer uses NASA’s psychological research on these two methods to create a trained ChatGPT-like therapist.</p><p> After logging in with your Google account, you’ll have to pick which type of therapy you want to try. Then, start a new chat and answer the questions that SommerAI asks. The more detailed and communicative you are, the better the bot responds. Your chats are saved in your account, so when you revisit it later, you can choose to start a new chat for a new topic or revisit that topic and take the conversation further; in the latter, the AI should perform better as it has more data from the past chat.</p><p> Apart from these two main chat therapy bots, SommerAI also offers <strong>Healthy Nuggets</strong>. These small actions, habits, or exercises will boost your mental health.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Mindsum-Bot"><a href="#3-Mindsum-Bot" class="headerlink" title="3.

It has recently created an AI chatbot called Mindsum Bot, which can give anyone the correct information about any mental health questions and guide them in seeking professional help.</p><p> Mindsum says the bot was built on GPT technology and layered with their own AI models. It is trained on three evidence-based clinically-tested therapeutic practices: CBT, IPT, and DBT. Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) is a short-term depression treatment focusing on social interactions. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a modified type of CBT that teaches how to regulate emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and be more mindful.</p><p> This training and backing of an established mental health organization makes Mindsum Bot much more reliable than other therapy chatbots. It’s not restricted to UK users, as anyone worldwide can use it. The makers recommend using it as a place to vent your thoughts when you don’t have someone to listen to them, and Mindsum Bot will even help you identify the right time to seek professional advice if needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-JungGPT"><a href="#4-JungGPT" class="headerlink" title="4.

It uses casual language and reframes what you’ve written while offering empathy and asking a question that could take you to the next step in resolving the situation. The whole process makes it feel like you’re talking to a friend.</p><p> JungGPT has been trained on several texts and a language model that facilitates emotional understanding. The makers at Ventura UX are quick to point this out. “While JungGPT does have a ‘form’ of empathy, it does not feel empathy itself, but understands it based on its training to do so and through analyzing text in different context.”</p><p> When we signed up and tested JungGPT, it was as simple as using any ChatGPT-like AI chatbot. The site notes that the free plan has limited messaging, but we didn’t hit those restrictions in our usage. The premium plan costs $7 per month for unlimited messaging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Lotus"><a href="#5-Lotus" class="headerlink" title="5.

Head to the web app, and you’re ready to start chatting. The makers say, “Unlike other language models, Lotus has been meticulously trained on millions of user conversations to enhance its effectiveness and provide tailored solutions for individuals seeking support.”</p><p> While you don’t need to register for an account to use Lotus, it’s best that you do. With that account, you get a built-in journal and goals tracker. When you’re conversing with the chatbot, Lotus will suggest concrete steps to tackle the issues you are having. It will then prompt you to add these as small goals or to add the complete response to your journal.</p><p> This way, you can revisit Lotus and quickly go through the main parts of the previous conversation. It also serves as a quick reminder of your goals, and Lotus will use those in any follow-up conversations you have.</p><h2 id="AI-Helps-But-Isn’t-a-Replacement-for-Therapy"><a href="#AI-Helps-But-Isn’t-a-Replacement-for-Therapy" class="headerlink" title="AI Helps But Isn’t a Replacement for Therapy"></a>AI Helps But Isn’t a Replacement for Therapy</h2><p> While we stated this at the start of this article, it’s worth reiterating that these AI chatbots cannot substitute for a qualified professional mental health counselor.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-Does-GPT4All-Achieve-Its-Results"><a href="#How-Does-GPT4All-Achieve-Its-Results" class="headerlink" title="How Does GPT4All Achieve Its Results?"></a>How Does GPT4All Achieve Its Results?</h2><p> OpenAI’s GPT models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), but unless you pay for premium access to OpenAI’s services, you won’t be able to fine-tune and integrate their GPT models into your applications. Furthermore, OpenAI will have access to all your conversations, which may be a security issue if you use ChatGPT for business and other more sensitive areas of your life. If you’re not keen on this, you may want to try out GPT4All.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> So what exactly is GPT4All? How does it work, and why use it over ChatGPT?</p><h2 id="What-Is-GPT4All"><a href="#What-Is-GPT4All" class="headerlink" title="What Is GPT4All?"></a>What Is GPT4All?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/featured.jpg"                      alt="Official webpage for GPT4All"                ></p><p> GPT4All is an open-source ecosystem used for integrating LLMs into applications without paying for a platform or hardware subscription. It was created by Nomic AI, an information cartography company that aims to improve access to AI resources.</p><p> GPT4All is designed to run on modern to relatively modern PCs without needing an internet connection or even a GPU! This is possible since most of the models provided by GPT4All have been quantized to be as small as a few gigabytes, requiring only 4–16GB RAM to run.</p><p> This allows smaller businesses, organizations, and independent researchers to use and integrate an LLM for specific applications. And with GPT4All easily installable through a one-click installer, people can now use GPT4All and many of its LLMs for content creation, writing code, understanding documents, and information gathering.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-GPT4ALL-Over-ChatGPT"><a href="#Why-Use-GPT4ALL-Over-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Why Use GPT4ALL Over ChatGPT?"></a>Why Use GPT4ALL Over ChatGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bruce-mars-xj8qrwvuoes-unsplash-1.jpg"                      alt="Man thinking deeply"                ></p><p>Image Credit:bruce mars&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://unsplash.com/photos/xj8qrWvuOEs" >Unsplash <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> There are several reasons why you might want to use GPT4All over ChatGPT.</p><ul><li><strong>Portability:</strong> Models provided by GPT4All only require four to eight gigabytes of memory storage, do not require a GPU to run, and can easily be saved on a USB flash drive with the GPT4All one-click installer. This makes GPT4All and its models truly portable and usable on just about any modern computer out there.</li><li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> As explained earlier, unless you have access to ChatGPT Plus, all your ChatGPT conversions are accessible by OpenAI. GPT4All is focused on data transparency and privacy; your data will only be saved on your local hardware unless you intentionally share it with GPT4All to help grow their models.</li><li><strong>Offline Mode:</strong> GPT is a proprietary model requiring API access and a constant internet connection to query or access the model. If you lose an internet connection or have a server problem, you won’t have access to ChatGPT. This is not the case with GPT4All. Since all the data is already stored on a four to eight-gigabyte package, and inferencing is done locally, you do not require an internet connection to access any models in GPT4All. You can continue chatting and fine-tuning your model even without an internet connection.</li><li><strong>Free and Open Source:</strong> Several LLMs provided by GPT4All are licensed under GPL-2. This allows anyone to fine-tune and integrate their own models for commercial use without needing to pay for licensing.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-GPT4All-Works"><a href="#How-GPT4All-Works" class="headerlink" title="How GPT4All Works"></a>How GPT4All Works</h2><p> As discussed earlier, GPT4All is an ecosystem used to train and deploy LLMs locally on your computer, which is an incredible feat! Typically, loading a standard 25-30GB LLM would take 32GB RAM and an enterprise-grade GPU.</p><p> To compare, the LLMs you can use with GPT4All only require 3GB-8GB of storage and can run on 4GB–16GB of RAM. This makes running an entire LLM on an edge device possible without needing a GPU or external cloud assistance.</p><p> The hardware requirements to run LLMs on GPT4All have been significantly reduced thanks to neural network quantization. By reducing precision weight and activations in a neural network, many of the models provided by GPT4All can be run on most relatively modern computers.</p><p> The training data used in some of the available models were collected through “the pile,” which is just scraped data from publicly released content on the internet. The data is then sent to Nomic AI’s Atlas AI database, which can be seen based on correlations on an easy-to-see 2D vector map (also known as <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-vector-database/" >an AI vector database <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/atlas.jpg"                      alt="Illustration on how Atlas works"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> By Nomic AI training the Groovy model and using publicly available data, Nomic AI was able to release the model on an open GPL license which allows anyone to use it, even for commercial applications.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Install-GPT4All"><a href="#How-to-Install-GPT4All" class="headerlink" title="How to Install GPT4All"></a>How to Install GPT4All</h2><p> Installing GPT4All is simple, and now that GPT4All version 2 has been released, it is even easier! The best way to install GPT4All 2 is to download the one-click installer:</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://gpt4all.io/index.html" >GPT4All <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Windows, macOS, or Linux (Free)</p><p> The following instructions are for Windows, but you can install GPT4All on each major operating system.</p><p> Once downloaded, double-click on the installer and select <strong>Install</strong>. Windows Defender may see the installation as malicious because the process for Microsoft to give valid signatures for 3rd party applications can take a long time. However, this should be fixed soon. As of writing, as long as you downloaded the GPT4All application from the official website, you should be safe. Click on <strong>Install Anyway</strong> to install GPT4All.</p><p> Once you open the application, you will need to select a model to use. GPT4ALL provides you with several models, all of which will have their strengths and weaknesses. To know which model to download, here is a table showing their strengths and weaknesses.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Size</th><th>Note</th><th>Parameters</th><th>Type</th><th>Quantization</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hermes</strong></td><td>7.58 GB</td><td>Instruction Based  Gives long responses  Curated with 300,000 uncensored instructions  Cannot be used commercially</td><td>13 Billion</td><td>LLaMA</td><td>q4_0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPT4All Falcon</strong></td><td>3.78 GB</td><td>Fast responses  Instruction based  Licensed for commercial use</td><td>7 Billion</td><td>Falcon</td><td>q4_0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Groovy</strong></td><td>8 GB</td><td>Fast responses  -Creative responses  Instruction based  Licensed for commercial use</td><td>7 Billion</td><td>GPT-J</td><td>q4_0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo</strong></td><td>Minimal</td><td>Requires personal API  Will send your chats to OpenAI  GPT4All is only used to communicate with OpenAI</td><td>?</td><td>GPT</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ChatGPT-4</strong></td><td>Minimal</td><td>Requires personal API  Will send your chats to OpenAI  GPT4All is only used to communicate with OpenAI</td><td>?</td><td>GPT</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Snoozy</strong></td><td>7.58 GB</td><td>Instruction based  Slower than Groovy but with higher quality responses  Cannot be used commercially</td><td>13 Billion</td><td>LLaMA</td><td>q4_0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MPT Chat</strong></td><td>4.52 GB</td><td>Fast responses  Chat based  Cannot be used commercially</td><td>7 Billion</td><td>MPT</td><td>q4_0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Orca</strong></td><td>3.53 GB</td><td>Instruction based  Explains tuned datasets  Orca Research Paper dataset construction approaches  Licensed for commercial use</td><td>7 Billion</td><td>OpenLLaMA</td><td>q4_0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vicuna</strong></td><td>3.92 GB</td><td>Instruction based  Cannot be used commercially</td><td>7 Billion</td><td>LLaMA</td><td>q4_2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wizard</strong></td><td>3.92 GB</td><td>Instruction based  Cannot be used commercially</td><td>7 Billion</td><td>LLaMA</td><td>q4_2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wizard Uncensored</strong></td><td>7.58 GB</td><td>Instruction based  Cannot be used commercially</td><td>13 Billion</td><td>LLaMA</td><td>q4_0</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Keep in mind that the models provided have different levels of restrictions. Not all models can be used commercially for free; some will need more hardware resources, while others will need an API key. The least restrictive models available in GPT4All are Groovy, GPT4All Falcon, and Orca.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-Train-GPT4All-Models"><a href="#Can-You-Train-GPT4All-Models" class="headerlink" title="Can You Train GPT4All Models?"></a>Can You Train GPT4All Models?</h2><p> Yes, but not the quantized versions. To effectively fine-tune GPT4All models, you need to download the raw models and use enterprise-grade GPUs such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-amd-instinct-ai-accelerators/" >AMD’s Instinct Accelerators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or NVIDIA’s Ampere or Hopper GPUs. Additionally, you will need to train the model through an AI training framework like LangChain, which will require some technical knowledge.</p><p> Fine-tuning a GPT4All model will require some monetary resources as well as some technical know-how, but if you only want to feed a GPT4All model custom data, you can keep training the model through retrieval augmented generation (which helps a language model access and understand information outside its base training to complete tasks). You can do so by prompting the GPT4All to model your custom data before asking a question. Custom data should be saved locally, and when prompted, the model should be able to provide you with the info you once gave.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713322&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVRadio1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV Radio Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Use-GTP4All"><a href="#Should-You-Use-GTP4All" class="headerlink" title="Should You Use GTP4All?"></a>Should You Use GTP4All?</h2><p> The idea for GPT4All is to provide a free-to-use and open-source platform where people can run large language models on their computers. Currently, GPT4All and its quantized models are great for experimenting, learning, and trying out different LLMs in a secure environment. For professional workloads, we would still recommend using ChatGPT as the model is significantly more capable.</p><p> Overall, there isn’t any reason you should limit yourself to one.

After consuming billions of words from the internet, including sources like websites, articles, and Reddit discussions, the language models can now produce human-like text.Individuals and companies are already using AI text generators to churn out thematically relevant essays, press releases, and even songs! But there are risks.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><h2 id="The-Dangers-of-AI-Writing"><a href="#The-Dangers-of-AI-Writing" class="headerlink" title="The Dangers of AI Writing"></a>The Dangers of AI Writing</h2><p> From the risk of misinformation to losing your brand voice, there are many dangers associated with using AI to produce content. Here are the top five dangers of using AI to generate written content.</p><h3 id="1-Misinformation"><a href="#1-Misinformation" class="headerlink" title="1. Misinformation"></a>1. Misinformation</h3><p> Generating text using AI is easy. You only need to write a prompt, and the AI text generator will add content it believes could logically follow.</p><p> Despite the fact that ChatGPT and other <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-writing-tools/" >AI writing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can write texts that look plausible, their assertions are not necessarily accurate. AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on, meaning it’s susceptible to bias and misinformation.</p><p> For instance, Stack Overflow,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/helpful-developer-communities-online/" >an online community for developers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , temporarily banned users from sharing answers generated by ChatGPT, citing that “the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low.”</p><p> Sharing incorrect information can be particularly detrimental when it comes to topics that have the potential to negatively impact someone’s health or finances.</p><h3 id="2-Quality-Concerns-and-Possible-Plagiarism"><a href="#2-Quality-Concerns-and-Possible-Plagiarism" class="headerlink" title="2. Quality Concerns and Possible Plagiarism"></a>2. Quality Concerns and Possible Plagiarism</h3><p> AI-based content generators are essentially web scrapers that can learn from data fed to them and generate new ideas or better-quality content. But they, now and then, fall short of this goal.</p><p> AI writing tools don’t actually understand the text they generate, as they basically collect information from the internet and reword it. This could result in content that has issues like misplaced statistics and sentences without flow and coherence.</p><p> Another drawback of using AI to write is the increased likelihood of unintentional plagiarism.<a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/new-york-city-schools-ban-ai-chatbot-chatgpt" >The Guardian <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reports that one of the reasons schools in New York City banned ChatGPT is the risk of students using it to write assignments and passing them off as their work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Algorithms-Devaluing-Your-Content"><a href="#3-Algorithms-Devaluing-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="3. Algorithms Devaluing Your Content"></a>3. Algorithms Devaluing Your Content</h3><p> Publishers who use AI to write risk having their site penalized by search engines. According to Google, sites with lots of unhelpful content are less likely to rank well in Search. Google states that its team is constantly working to ensure users see more original, helpful content written by people, for people, in search results.</p><p> As previously stated, AI-written text may be incoherent and contain factual inconsistencies, making it unhelpful. This means if your site relied on AI content and took a hit after <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-to-write-for-google-helpful-content-update/" >Google’s helpful content update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it could be because the search engine found the content unhelpful or lacking in accuracy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Lack-of-Original-Ideas-Creativity-and-Personalization"><a href="#4-Lack-of-Original-Ideas-Creativity-and-Personalization" class="headerlink" title="4. Lack of Original Ideas, Creativity, and Personalization"></a>4. Lack of Original Ideas, Creativity, and Personalization</h3><p> Since AI tools use existing data to generate texts, they can produce content similar to what already exists. This can be a big problem for people or brands that plan to stand out from the competition by creating original content.</p><p> Creative content tends to be engaging and more shareable. The more your content is shared, the more you’ll be able to raise awareness and build relationships with people.</p><p> Thought-provoking and unique content often include personal experiences, opinions, and analysis, which are a few areas where AI falls short, at least at present.</p><h3 id="5-Reputational-Risk-and-Watered-Down-Brand-Voice"><a href="#5-Reputational-Risk-and-Watered-Down-Brand-Voice" class="headerlink" title="5. Reputational Risk and Watered-Down Brand Voice"></a>5. Reputational Risk and Watered-Down Brand Voice</h3><p> Reputational risk refers to any threat or danger that can damage an individual or company’s good name or standing. This risk can occur if your brand publishes error-ridden AI-written posts that your audience finds distasteful.</p><p> People want to feel connected, so brands that feel relatable on a human level tend to be more attractive.</p><p> A brand’s voice can make you smile, cry, and even feel empowered. Unfortunately, while many AI text generators allow you to set the tone of voice when generating the content, the results are either a hit or a miss.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Spot-AI-Generated-Text"><a href="#How-to-Spot-AI-Generated-Text" class="headerlink" title="How to Spot AI-Generated Text"></a>How to Spot AI-Generated Text</h2><p> Do you want to know if a human or AI wrote what you’re reading? Being able to spot AI-generated text can help you evaluate its credibility. Here are a few ways to spot AI-generated text.</p><h3 id="1-Look-for-Repetition-of-Words-and-Phrases"><a href="#1-Look-for-Repetition-of-Words-and-Phrases" class="headerlink" title="1. Look for Repetition of Words and Phrases"></a>1.

This is due to the AI tool adding a series of what it thinks are relevant sentences to reach the target word count.</p><p> So, if you’re reading an article, and it seems like the same words are being used repeatedly, then it was probably written by an AI writing assistant. Many AI text generators tend to repeat words like “the,” “it,” and “is” more frequently.</p><p> Also, if an article seems to follow a specific pattern or formula, it may have been generated by AI. This kind of writing often makes content predictable and mind-numbing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Search-for-Unnatural-Transitions-and-Errors"><a href="#2-Search-for-Unnatural-Transitions-and-Errors" class="headerlink" title="2.

This could lead to content that lacks the coherence and logical flow of human-written content.</p><p> AI-generated content is sometimes characterized by grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors, and even paragraphs with a disjointed structure.</p><p> Unsurprisingly, though, excellent grammar can be a sign of machine-generated text. This is because grammar is rule-based; AI systems are usually better than people at following logic.</p><h3 id="3-Examine-Any-Fact-Heavy-Dry-Texts"><a href="#3-Examine-Any-Fact-Heavy-Dry-Texts" class="headerlink" title="3.

Popular AI content detector tools include GPT-2 Output Detector, GLTR (Giant Language Model Test Room), and GPTZero.</p><p> You can also use a paid or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/free-plagiarism-detection-tools-freelancers/" >free plagiarism checker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see if the text is original.

ChatGPT Enterprise removes these restraints, providing unlimited conversational queries with its upgraded GPT-4 model. This allows your team to fully utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities without worrying about running into limits.</p><p> The enterprise version also delivers up to two times faster response times compared to the regular versions, enabling more dynamic back-and-forth conversations. Long input delays are eliminated, and you get answers rapidly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Increased-Context-for-Complex-Questions"><a href="#Increased-Context-for-Complex-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Increased Context for Complex Questions"></a>Increased Context for Complex Questions</h3><p> ChatGPT Enterprise expands the context window to 32,000 tokens, four times more than the regular GPT-4 model (with 8192 tokens). This enables processing significantly longer and more detailed inputs.</p><p> You can pose multifaceted questions, input large passages of text, or provide broader background information to guide ChatGPT’s responses.

Two major categories within AI are “strong AI” and “weak AI,” representing different approaches to machine intelligence.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Now, let’s look into the fundamental differences between strong AI and weak AI and explore the current state of AI technology.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Weak-AI"><a href="#What-Is-Weak-AI" class="headerlink" title="What Is Weak AI?"></a>What Is Weak AI?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/b865d1fe2bcace495751c454db93866647380420be6c31ae58cdceea73012a33.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT chat and website open on two monitors"                ></p><p> Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, refers to AI applications that are specifically designed to automate tasks requiring a particular cognitive skill. This category of AI utilizes machine learning models tailored for specific tasks such as object recognition, chatbot interactions, personal voice assistants, autocorrect systems, and Google search algorithms, among others.</p><p> You might be wondering why this category of AI is referred to as “weak” AI. The term “weak” may mistakenly imply that these AI applications are lacking in some way. However, it is important to recognize that the rapid advancements in AI and their pervasive impact across various industries are largely due to narrow machine intelligence. The label “weak” indicates that these applications focus on a specific or narrow cognitive function.</p><h3 id="Applications-of-Weak-AI"><a href="#Applications-of-Weak-AI" class="headerlink" title="Applications of Weak AI"></a>Applications of Weak AI</h3><p> ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Bard are just a few examples of the AI tools that took the world by storm in 2022 and 2023. It is remarkable that so many <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-different-professions-using-ai/" >professions are utilizing their widespread application <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, even sparking debates about the potential for AI to replace humans and leaving many of us with the question, “<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-replace-me/" >Can ChatGPT replace me? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“</p><p> However, it’s important to note that these amazing tools are still classified as examples of “weak AI” in action.</p><p> Let’s explore seven common applications of weak AI:</p><ol><li><strong>Email spam filters:</strong> Features designed to detect and divert spam emails to the spam folder.</li><li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Tools that utilize <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/" >Natural Language Processing (NLP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to interact with humans are another instance of weak AI.</li><li><strong>AI artists:</strong> Computer-generated art using AI can transform natural language instructions into images and also falls under the umbrella of narrow AI.</li><li><strong>Smart voice assistants:</strong> Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and others can perform numerous tasks on your behalf by responding to voice commands.</li><li><strong>Social media algorithms:</strong> The recommendations on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or even Spotify are all powered by weak AI algorithms.</li><li><strong>Autonomous driving:</strong> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/not-just-tesla-cars-with-self-driving-features/" >self-driving feature in vehicles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is yet another application of weak AI.</li><li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-ai-apps-monitor-your-health/" >AI applications in healthcare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, such as medical diagnostic systems capable of identifying diseases with minimal human intervention, serve as additional examples of weak AI in action.</li></ol><p> Despite the term “weak AI,” it’s clear that it has numerous real-world applications that we’re already using.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Limitations-of-Weak-AI"><a href="#Limitations-of-Weak-AI" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Weak AI"></a>Limitations of Weak AI</h3><p> The primary reason for the limitations of AI today is its focus on automating specific tasks for humans. For example, ChatGPT and Google Bard are designed as <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >large language models (LLMs) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. They are specifically programmed for generating text-based content. Similarly, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are text-to-image generators limited to this particular function.</p><p> Let’s explore some of the limitations and drawbacks of weak AI:</p><ul><li>Limited capabilities due to task-specific models.</li><li>Narrow AI applications depend highly on data, requiring large datasets to learn and perform certain tasks.</li><li>By extension, the use of large datasets can create privacy and data processing issues.,</li><li>Weak AI often relies on human intervention to execute tasks, which can introduce human biases into the process.</li><li>These applications may be susceptible to cyber threats and vulnerabilities.</li></ul><p> However, despite these limitations, tools like ChatGPT have become effectively indispensable within a short period of public release.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Strong-AI-or-AGI"><a href="#What-Is-Strong-AI-or-AGI" class="headerlink" title="What Is Strong AI or AGI?"></a>What Is Strong AI or AGI?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-of-a-white-robot.jpg"                      alt="Image of a white robot"                ></p><p> In contrast to weak AI exists strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). This form of AI is based on the belief that computational power can emulate human brain capabilities, including analytical thinking and other intellectual abilities. Strong AI aims to create machines capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do, not necessarily in the same way as humans.</p><p> Unlike weak AI, strong AI does not rely on specific programmed models for performing narrow tasks. Instead, it possesses the potential to handle general tasks by simulating human brain functions. AGI has the ability to enable technological systems to evolve over time and adapt to changes in the environment.</p><p> It will be strong AI that will likely lead to the singularity. However, it is important to note that strong AI is still a distant goal, as much of the work in this field remains largely theoretical. The concept of strong AI itself often draws inspiration from science fiction movies and novels.</p><h3 id="Applications-of-Strong-AI"><a href="#Applications-of-Strong-AI" class="headerlink" title="Applications of Strong AI"></a>Applications of Strong AI</h3><p> Since the development of strong AI still needs to be completed, finding it in practical, real-world scenarios is nearly impossible, rendering much of the talk about its use and development purely theoretical. However, here are five anticipated applications where strong AI could be utilized:</p><ol><li><strong>Emotional intelligence and thought processing:</strong> The understanding of human emotions and thought processes can be incorporated into AGI systems, benefiting industries such as healthcare, education, and customer services.</li><li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Machines equipped with strong AI can possess the ability to make autonomous decisions based on rationality.</li><li><strong>Evolution:</strong> Strong AI systems could enable machines to adapt and modify themselves to better fit their surroundings.</li><li><strong>Consciousness:</strong> Self-awareness and conscious decision-making capabilities could be achieved through strong AI systems.</li><li><strong>Artificial creativity:</strong> Strong AI may unlock the potential for artificial creativity, allowing machines to generate innovative ideas without human instructions.</li></ol><p> Despite the largely theoretical nature of AGI, it clearly has enormous potential.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-Strong-AI"><a href="#Limitations-of-Strong-AI" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Strong AI"></a>Limitations of Strong AI</h3><p> Strong AI or AGI has the potential to be transformative for our society. However, several considerations and challenges must be addressed when implementing such systems.</p><ul><li>Complexity, as strong AI requires vast amounts of data and high computational power for training.</li><li>Ethical considerations that arise from the uncertainty surrounding the behavior of strong AI in real-world scenarios (e.g., AGI systems may make harmful decisions for humans).</li><li>AGI systems will rely heavily on human data, which may lead to human-borne biases.</li><li>Security and responsibility for the actions of strong AI (e.g., determining who should be held accountable when things go wrong).</li></ul><p> Given the world-changing potential of AGI, extensive regulation must be in place before any such product is released to the public.

You can explore the app, ask a few questions, and see how it works without signing up. However, if you see yourself using the app after your test, we’d recommend you sign up. That way, you can preserve your search history so you can always refer to it.</p><p> You can use Perplexity for a wide range of purposes, including research, professional development, and content creation. Perplexity AI is also perfect for answering those random questions that pop into your head, from “How to make a homemade kite?” and “Why do we stuff pillows with feathers?” to much more complex queries. It provides quick, reliable answers that satisfy your curiosity.</p><p> Perplexity is free to use. However, you can upgrade to its Pro plan ($20&#x2F;month) for access to additional features, such as unlimited access to its more powerful AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet, and Mistral’s Large, plus support for images and files, and better support.</p><h2 id="Can-Perplexity-AI-Replace-Google"><a href="#Can-Perplexity-AI-Replace-Google" class="headerlink" title="Can Perplexity AI Replace Google?"></a>Can Perplexity AI Replace Google?</h2><p> While Perplexity AI offers a unique value proposition, it’s not positioned to replace Google entirely. Google’s vast data infrastructure and established user base give it an advantage in many areas. Perplexity excels in providing AI overviews of user queries. However, it’s not effective for several other uses that Google has come to be known for, like weather forecasts and geo-sensitive queries.</p><p> For example, a search for “bakery near me” returned a “summary” of a list of bakeries. The interesting part? Not one from its list was within a 100-mile radius. The same query on Google returned options within a five-mile radius, which is absolutely what I wanted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-showing-search-result-on-perplexity.jpg"                      alt="screenshot showing search result on perplexity"                ></p><p> It’s worth noting that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-google-ai-powered-search/" >Google has been testing Search Generative Experience (SGE) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an AI-assisted search feature. SGE provides AI overviews of search queries similar to Perplexity AI. Perplexity AI currently does a better job of answering queries thoroughly and also provides in-text citations for cross-referencing. However, this is something Google can replicate, if it becomes where the battle line is drawn.</p><p> Perplexity AI is reportedly working on bringing ads to its platform, per <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24118154/perplexity-will-try-a-form-of-ads-on-its-ai-search-platform" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. How it executes its ad features will determine much of the platform’s future. Perplexity has a lot to prove (and improve!) to really stand up to Google.</p><p> Perplexity AI’s journey is one to watch, as it has the potential to carve out a significant niche in the search engine market. Its success will largely depend on how it integrates additional capabilities and responds to user feedback. Whether it will ever stand toe-to-toe with Google remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Perplexity AI is a tool worth watching and, more importantly, using.</p><p> Perplexity AI has caught the attention of tech leaders and users alike. From being backed by Jeff Bezos to being used “almost every day” by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Perplexity AI fits the bill of an app that could change how we search.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But what is Perplexity AI really about, and can you use it instead of Google?</p><h2 id="What-Is-Perplexity-AI-and-What-Can-You-Do-With-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-Perplexity-AI-and-What-Can-You-Do-With-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Perplexity AI, and What Can You Do With It?"></a>What Is Perplexity AI, and What Can You Do With It?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-16-123353-1.jpg"                      alt="screenshot showing perplexity ai on desktop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Perplexity AI is a conversational search engine that uses natural language text to answer questions.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparing-the-Next-Gen-GPT-4’s-Leap-over-GPT-3-5"><a href="#Comparing-the-Next-Gen-GPT-4’s-Leap-over-GPT-3-5" class="headerlink" title="Comparing the Next Gen: GPT-4’s Leap over GPT-3.5"></a>Comparing the Next Gen: GPT-4’s Leap over GPT-3.5</h2><p> After all the speculation and claims regarding the abilities of GPT-4, the much anticipated fourth iteration of the GPT family of language models launched on March 14, 2023.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> GPT-4 didn’t come with some of the much-touted features it was rumored to have. However, the latest model significantly improves on GPT-3.5 and its predecessors. But how is GPT-4 different from GPT-3.5? We’ll take you through some key differences between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.</p><h2 id="1-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Creativity"><a href="#1-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Creativity" class="headerlink" title="1. GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: Creativity"></a>1. GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: Creativity</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gpt-4-language-model-with-openai-logo.jpg"                      alt="gpt-4 language model with OpenAI logo"                ></p><p> One of the most pronounced advantages of the GPT-4 model over GPT-3.5 is its ability to provide more creative replies to prompts. Don’t get me wrong; GPT-3.5 is very creative. There’s a long list of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-openai/" >creative things you can do with ChatGPT that uses the model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, it already outperforms many large language models in terms of creativity.</p><p> However, GPT-4 raises the bar even further. Although GPT-4’s creative advantage may not be apparent when trying to solve basic problems, the difference in creativity between both models becomes apparent as the task becomes harder and requires a higher level of creativity.</p><p> For example, if you ask both models to complete a creative task like writing a poem using both English and French on each line of the poem, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt4/" >ChatGPT powered by the latest GPT-4 model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will deliver better results. While GPT-4’s response would use both languages on every line, GPT-3.5 would alternate between both languages instead, with each line using one language and the next using the other.</p><h2 id="2-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Image-or-Visual-Inputs"><a href="#2-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Image-or-Visual-Inputs" class="headerlink" title="2. GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: Image or Visual Inputs"></a>2. GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: Image or Visual Inputs</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/picture-of-circuitry-and-a-human-head.jpg"                      alt="Picture of circuitry and a human head"                ></p><p> While GPT-3.5 can only accept text prompts, GPT-4 is multi-modal and can accept both text and visual inputs. To be clear, when we say visual inputs, the image doesn’t have to be an image of a typed prompt—it can be an image of anything. So from an image of a handwritten math problem to Reddit memes, GPT-4 can understand and describe almost any image.</p><p> Unlike GPT-3, GPT-4 is both a language and a visual model.</p><p> During the GPT-4 announcement live stream, an OpenAI engineer fed the model with a screenshot of a Discord server. GPT-4 could describe every detail on it, including the names of users online at the time. An image of a hand-drawn mockup of a joke website was also fed to the model with instructions to turn it into a website, and amazingly, GPT-4 provided a working code for a website that matched the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Safer-Responses"><a href="#3-GPT-4-vs-GPT-3-5-Safer-Responses" class="headerlink" title="3.

With GPT-3.5, OpenAI took a more moderation-based approach to safety. In other words, some of the safety measures were more of an afterthought. OpenAI monitored what users did and the questions they asked, identified flaws, and tried to fix them on the go.</p><p> With GPT-4, most safety measures are already baked into the system at the model level. To understand the difference, it’s like building a house with robust materials from the get-go versus using anything that goes and then trying to patch things as faults emerge.

In AI lingo, this is called “AI hallucination” and can cause distrust of AI-generated information.</p><p> ​​​​​​</p><p> In GPT-4, hallucination is still a problem. However, according to the GPT-4 technical report, the new model is 19% to 29% less likely to hallucinate when compared to the GPT-3.5 model. But this isn’t just about the technical report.

A context window is how much data a model can retain in its “memory” during a chat session and for how long. GPT-4 has a significantly better context size and window than its predecessor model.</p><p> In practical terms, this means that GPT-4 can better remember the context of a conversation for longer, as well as the instructions given during the conversation.</p><p> An issue with GPT-3.5 is the propensity of the model to go off-topic or fail to follow instructions as you progress during the course of a conversation. You could, for instance, tell the model to address you by your name, and it would do so for a while but then fail to follow the instructions along the way. Although this problem still exists with the GPT-4 model, it is less of an issue because of a better context window.</p><p> Another issue is the limitation on the volume of text you can use in a prompt at once. Summarizing long text using GPT-3 typically means splitting the text into multiple chunks and summarizing them bit by bit. The improvement in context length in the GPT-4 model means you can paste entire PDFs at a go and get the model to summarize without splitting it into chunks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="GPT-4-A-Step-Up-from-GPT-3-5"><a href="#GPT-4-A-Step-Up-from-GPT-3-5" class="headerlink" title="GPT-4: A Step Up from GPT-3.5"></a>GPT-4: A Step Up from GPT-3.5</h2><p> Undoubtedly, GPT-4 is a significant step up from its predecessor models.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Your-Complete-Guide-to-ChatGPT"><a href="#Your-Complete-Guide-to-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Your Complete Guide to ChatGPT"></a>Your Complete Guide to ChatGPT</h2><p> Initially released in November 2022, ChatGPT gave many of us an intriguing glimpse into what a future with AI might look like. Perhaps one where we don’t need to fret over how to write an email to our boss or can call on an AI personal assistant to explain difficult concepts quickly and simply.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> Besides being able to compose a work email, ChatGPT can give you feedback on your presentation, suggest an itinerary for a weekend away, or brainstorm new ideas when you’re out of mental energy. With ChatGPT, you type your request and hit enter to see a response appear before you in a matter of seconds.</p><p> Want to learn how to use ChatGPT? We’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id="What-Is-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-Is-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What Is ChatGPT?"></a>What Is ChatGPT?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/home-page-of-chatgpt-website-october-2023.jpg"                      alt="Home page of ChatGPT website october 2023"                ></p><p> ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot that can answer almost any question you have—just as if Google were a person you could have a casual conversation with.</p><p> ChatGPT is special because it doesn’t feel like you’re talking to a computer. It can converse in natural language and remember things you’ve asked before, and in the first of its kind, it can understand voice and images too. If you took a picture of the contents inside your refrigerator, for example, it could suggest something you might want to cook for dinner based on the ingredients you have.</p><p> Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT was trained on an enormous amount of data from the internet, which probably included troves of information from places like Wikipedia, blogs, how-to websites, and scientific articles. <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-chatgpt-accessing-up-to-date-information-means/" >ChatGPT can now browse the web <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adding more power to an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="How-ChatGPT-Works"><a href="#How-ChatGPT-Works" class="headerlink" title="How ChatGPT Works"></a>How ChatGPT Works</h2><p> ChatGPT was trained using a mix of machine learning and human intervention, using a method called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p><p> In fact, the first stage of training involved humans playing the role of both a human user and an AI assistant having a conversation. This helped demonstrate responses that humans prefer and go towards building a large dataset to feed the model.</p><p> Next, a reward model needed to be created for reinforcement learning. To do this, human AI trainers once again stepped in, but this time, they were asked to rank several model answers by quality, further helping ChatGPT choose the best response.</p><p> All of this is to say humans had a hand in helping to train ChatGPT to achieve a higher level of accuracy in its answers, but also to make sure that it sounded natural to talk to.</p><p> Far from being perfect, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/" >there are many problems facing ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, from confidently stating wrong facts to being a weapon for disinformation.

After the ChatGPT login page, like an ordinary messaging app, you type in the text box and hit enter or click the send button (paper airplane symbol).</p><p> Responses are generated quite fast, appearing directly underneath your question. Any follow-up questions will be added to the conversation thread, which you can look back on at any time.</p><p> Conversations are saved and stored in a panel on the left. If you want to start a fresh conversation, click the <strong>trash can icon</strong> beside the conversation heading to delete the thread, or press the <strong>New Chat</strong> button to start a new one.</p><p> ChatGPT is optimized for dialogue, so you don’t need to type out full sentences each time you have a follow-up question. You can try asking ChatGPT to summarize an answer or paraphrase a response if it doesn’t seem to answer your question well at first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-to-summarize-a-response.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to summarize a response"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Ask-ChatGPT"><a href="#What-to-Ask-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="What to Ask ChatGPT"></a>What to Ask ChatGPT</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/asking-chatgpt-for-a-few-iconic-places-to-visit-in-nyc.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT for a few iconic places to visit in NYC"                ></p><p> Many people turn to Google when they want to ask how something works, but sifting through a website takes time. Instead of putting that question to the internet, you can use ChatGPT to get a quick and straightforward answer.</p><p> Not to mention, there’s the added benefit of having no annoying ads. You can also ask ChatGPT to present the information in the best way for you, for example, as a bullet point list instead of a paragraph. And if the answer is going way over your head, request the info to be simplified for better understanding.</p><p> There are plenty of interesting <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/" >things you can do with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Take ChatGPTs answers with a grain of salt, and always do further research if you plan to use the info in a high-risk application.</p><p> Avoid using ChatGPT for medical advice, and don’t ask it for investment tips.

It’ll give you a list of subjects to review, and you both can take the idea from there.</p><p> If you have a topic in mind but want to find some inspiration for how to convey it, let ChatGPT know what theme you’re considering, and it’ll give you some choices for a direction to take your poem in.</p><h3 id="Realize-Structure-and-Form"><a href="#Realize-Structure-and-Form" class="headerlink" title="Realize Structure and Form"></a>Realize Structure and Form</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-structure.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT poetry structure and form decision"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Writing a poem with ChatGPT can be advantageous for a few reasons—one being that it can choose the structure and form of the poem for you. This includes the type of poem, like a sonnet or an ode, and the rhyme scheme.</p><p> After you know the topic of your poem, ask ChatGPT what kind of structure and form should be written about the theme. It’ll give you an option and ask if you want to continue. If it chooses a format you’re not interested in, just ask for something different.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Co-Create-Word-Choice-and-Imagery"><a href="#Co-Create-Word-Choice-and-Imagery" class="headerlink" title="Co-Create Word Choice and Imagery"></a>Co-Create Word Choice and Imagery</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-wording.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT poetry wording corrections"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17727588&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a><br><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17727588&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/Affiliates_300x250px_valentinesday.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> There’s a chance that ChatGPT may come up with the perfect poem on the first try.

It’s not coming up with a topic for you because the prompts are pretty generic. Instead, it’s merely giving you the inspirational push you need to get writing.</p><p> ChatGPT’s poetry prompts are especially effective when you’re stuck with massive writer’s block and aren’t sure how to proceed in your craft.</p><h3 id="Ask-for-Advice"><a href="#Ask-for-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Ask for Advice"></a>Ask for Advice</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-advice.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT options for how to make a poem sound better"                ></p><p> Treat ChatGPT like a friend about to read your latest piece of creative writing. You’re open to advice, but every comment and criticism isn’t going to make it to the final draft.</p><p> If you have a poem drafted or even just a few lines, you can ask the AI if it has any advice to make it better. Take the suggestions lightly and apply the ones you feel will help your piece of writing.</p><h3 id="Welcome-Research-and-References"><a href="#Welcome-Research-and-References" class="headerlink" title="Welcome Research and References"></a>Welcome Research and References</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-research.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT describing the petals of a cherry blossom"                ></p><p> ChatGPT has a plethora of knowledge at its disposal. If you’re writing a poem about a certain place or object, see if the AI can give the information you need to you. It’s like having a little virtual assistant on demand.</p><p> Simply ask ChatGPT for some information about the thing you need to know, and it’ll give you as many facts as you want. You can even ask for descriptions to help you create the imagery for your readers.</p><p> Keep in mind that if you’ve already begun a conversation about poetry with ChatGPT and ask for it to describe something, you’re likely going to get a poem. In your request for the information, simply clarify not to give it to you in poetic form.</p><h3 id="Discuss-Poetry-Elements"><a href="#Discuss-Poetry-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Discuss Poetry Elements"></a>Discuss Poetry Elements</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-poetic-elements.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT poetic device options"                ></p><p> Instead of asking ChatGPT to add poetic devices to your poem, ask it for a list of them. You can choose which elements you believe will work best in your poetry and come up with the words yourself.</p><p> Not only does this still make you the only contributor to your poetry, but you’ll also learn to use poetic devices you may not have come across before.

You are wowed by some of the ChatGPT screenshots posted by people online. But when you try out the new AI demo, you can’t seem to get a similar level of smart responses. The trick here is prompts.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> While ChatGPT is intelligent, its responses are dictated by the question or prompt you’ve entered. And like learning Google search operators to get the best search results, you’ll need to learn how to frame prompts for ChatGPT to give you the best responses, also known as Prompt Engineering (PE). It can be a little complicated for beginners, but that’s why several experienced users online share how to write ChatGPT prompts for the best answers.</p><h2 id="1-Prompts-Chat"><a href="#1-Prompts-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1.

Several of the prompts are generated by the site’s developer Fatih Kadir Akin, but since it’s open source, you’ll also find several user contributions for excellent prompts.</p><p> The focus is on making the prompts easy to use and copy-paste. You’ll find the prompt’s descriptive title at the top, like “Act as a Mathematician” or “Act as a Social Media Manager,” with the full prompt under it. You can edit this prompt on the website to customize it for what you’re looking for. Then, when you’re happy with the result, copy-paste it into ChatGPT and run it.</p><p> Akin has also written a free (or pay-what-you-want) ebook for beginners called <a class="link"   href="https://fka.gumroad.com/l/art-of-chatgpt-prompting" >The Art of ChatGPT Prompting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It takes you step-by-step through the ChatGPT process of understanding what the AI does, why prompts are essential, and the principles of good PE. Akin also shares his “Act as…” hack for making ChatGPT behave the way you want without overloading it with too much information.</p><h2 id="2-QuickRef-ChatGPT-Cheat-Sheets"><a href="#2-QuickRef-ChatGPT-Cheat-Sheets" class="headerlink" title="2.

The latest cheat sheet in its impressive lineup is ChatGPT, with a series of prompts and tips for the AI. You won’t learn the process of PE here, but it’s a good reference when you’re stuck.</p><p> QuickRef’s ChatGPT cheat sheet is divided into several categories: General, Coding, Email, Spreadsheets, Social Media, Reading, Design, Analyzing Data, Paid ads, Amazon FBA, Writing &#x2F; Blogging, Teachers &#x2F; Course Creators, YouTube, and Research. Each prompt has a basic headline telling you what it will do, followed by the prompt you can copy-paste into ChatGPT.</p><p> Multiple words or phrases of each prompt are replaceable to customize it for your query. The must-fill parts are marked in brackets for you to replace the original text, while optional replacements are colored red or blue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Adrian-Twarog"><a href="#3-Adrian-Twarog" class="headerlink" title="3.

He deep-dived into the system and has already made videos on creating a ChatGPT clone or making your Discord bot with the OpenAI models. Naturally, this requires understanding the core principles of how ChatGPT works, and he’s imparting all that knowledge in a series of YouTube videos.</p><p> In the Ultimate ChatGPT Resource Guide, Twarog explains what ChatGPT is in a quick five-minute video before moving on to a 35-minute crash course on how to use ChatGPT. In the second video, Twarog covers a lot on how to use prompts, focusing on use-case scenarios like summarization, templates, short stories, JavaScript, resumes, and blogging or editing. You’ll need to go through both of these to understand the basics before moving on in the series.</p><p> The third video, titled Advanced ChatGPT Guide, is the one you want to pay particular attention to if you want to understand advanced prompts. Twarog goes into details of prompt engineering with a series of examples. Even if the examples aren’t what you want to do with ChatGPT, go through these as an exercise to truly understand the finer points of composing a prompt.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Micah-Johns"><a href="#4-Micah-Johns" class="headerlink" title="4.

But if you’re only going to use it for more practical day-to-day stuff for your job or hobbies, the YouTube series by Micah Johns is a more beginner-friendly way to learn PE for ChatGPT.</p><p> The 40-minute ChatGPT Full Course is an excellent starting point, where Micah covers how to use the AI tool for writing resumes, composing important work emails, developing a learning plan for a new skill, problem-solving in Excel, automating a performance report, daily schedules, and meetings, prioritizing tasks, optimizing a LinkedIn profile, writing a cover letter, and communicating with vendors.</p><p> If any of these isn’t worth your time, you can skip ahead in the timestamps on the video or browse the whole course as a series of individual videos on each topic. Once you’re done with the 40-minute course, check out the longer 100-minute course that includes 20 advanced ChatGPT projects, such as Python scripting, JSON generation, medical study comprehension, and more.</p><p> Micah’s larger <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRc1YiX2Z0mpeXlmv6n7ZsVPVn-2etOua" >How to Use ChatGPT playlist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has several other real-world applications for ChatGPT.

It caters to a range of users, from complete novices to those with domain expertise or programming knowledge.</p><p> The course is entirely text-based, with chapters that take you through different aspects of AI prompting. Schulhoff defines PE as “How to talk to AI to get it to do what you want.” The Basics and Intermediate chapters will take you through the founding principles of PE with theory, tricks and tips, and examples.</p><p> The course then goes into advanced practices like applied prompting (contributed by users), fine-tuning, images, and more, where you’ll learn techniques like Chain of Thought, Self Consistency, etc. It might sound like a lot of jargon, but it’ll be clear and easy to understand if you go through the course step-by-step.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Start-Learning-ChatGPT-With-a-Personal-Project"><a href="#Start-Learning-ChatGPT-With-a-Personal-Project" class="headerlink" title="Start Learning ChatGPT With a Personal Project"></a>Start Learning ChatGPT With a Personal Project</h2><p> All these resources require you to have a ChatGPT account on OpenAI or use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-bing-ai-powered-change-search-experience/" >AI-powered search on Bing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

You’ve likely come across ChatGPT, a leading-edge solution that’s making significant waves across various industries.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> But using these AI systems isn’t just for big businesses. Let’s zero in on ChatGPT. If you’re a small business owner, there are plenty of ways to use this AI tool to boost your small business’s productivity and efficiency.</p><h2 id="1-Create-Content"><a href="#1-Create-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Create Content"></a>1. Create Content</h2><p> Whether you’re crafting a blog for your business website or scripting a video for your brand’s YouTube channel, ChatGPT can be your go-to content creator. This is particularly valuable for small businesses that may not yet have the budget for a dedicated content writer.</p><p> If you’re struggling to come up with a topic for your blog, ChatGPT can aid with brainstorming. The key is <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >creating detailed prompts with ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just share details like your audience and their buying stage and get tailored suggestions from the tool.</p><p> If you already have a specific idea or topic, you can flesh it out and tell ChatGPT what you want it to include in the content. From there, it can create article outlines, suggest titles, or even draft an entire blog. With an existing outline, ChatGPT can populate it with content, leaving you to simply fact-check and refine it.</p><p> While it may seem easy to outsource everything to ChatGPT, you should merely use it as a starting point. It’s critical to add your personality to any content that carries the brand of your business.</p><h2 id="2-Generate-Social-Media-Posts-Out-of-Existing-Content"><a href="#2-Generate-Social-Media-Posts-Out-of-Existing-Content" class="headerlink" title="2.

Don’t worry; ChatGPT can help populate your message templates. If you don’t have a template yet, you can ask ChatGPT to make one.</p><p> Just copy and paste your template into ChatGPT, ensuring it has all the necessary placeholders. Supply it with all it needs to fill in the placeholders and let it fill in the template. Once ChatGPT finishes generating a personalized message for each customer, all that’s left for you to do is copy and send them to your customers.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Text-Excel-Friendly"><a href="#4-Make-Text-Excel-Friendly" class="headerlink" title="4.

Transferring this data into an Excel sheet can be a laborious and time-consuming process.</p><p> ChatGPT can help you move all your data into Excel seamlessly. If your data is in a text format, you can copy-paste it directly into ChatGPT. If your inventory is in a handwritten note, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/convert-handwriting-text-ocr/" >scan the handwritten note and copy its text with OCR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Paste the text into ChatGPT and instruct it to make columns based on your preference.

Thankfully, ChatGPT can assist with language translation. Copy-paste the text and ask the AI tool to translate it into your native language. Simply input the text and request its translation into your preferred language. Also, if you’re unsure of a language, ChatGPT can help <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-language-is-this-5-online-tools-to-identify-almost-every-unknown-language/" >identify unknown languages for you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too.</p><h2 id="7-Write-Personalized-Emails"><a href="#7-Write-Personalized-Emails" class="headerlink" title="7.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Generative-AI-Simplified-Core-Ideas-Exposed"><a href="#Generative-AI-Simplified-Core-Ideas-Exposed" class="headerlink" title="Generative AI Simplified: Core Ideas Exposed"></a>Generative AI Simplified: Core Ideas Exposed</h2><p>ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google Bard are some of the most recognizable names in the world of consumer artificial intelligence. All three products have one thing in common—they are all generative AI products.But what exactly is generative AI, and what has sparked the recent fascination with this resurgent AI space?</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><h2 id="What-Is-Generative-AI"><a href="#What-Is-Generative-AI" class="headerlink" title="What Is Generative AI?"></a>What Is Generative AI?</h2><p> Generative AI, short for “generative artificial intelligence,” is a type of AI system that can generate unique or original content like text, audio, videos, or images on demand. Unlike some traditional AI systems designed for tasks like data classification or analysis, generative AI models are more concerned with producing novel or creative outputs based on the instructions they are given.</p><p> While generative AI may seem like a new technology, it has actually been around for decades. Several iterations and forms have been around at least as early as the 1960s. Artificial Intelligence is a vast field, and generative AI is just a subsection.</p><p> One of the most fascinating aspects of using a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-google-bard/" >generative AI tool like ChatGPT or Google’s Bard AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the ability of these tools to generate content that matches your request. You ask ChatGPT to write a poem in the style of William Shakespeare, and you get something strikingly similar to Shakespeare’s work. You ask it to create a speech in the style of Donald Trump, and you’d get something that impressively mimics the tone of the former US president. So, how is this possible? How is generative AI able to pull off such a fascinating feat?</p><h2 id="How-Generative-AI-Works"><a href="#How-Generative-AI-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Generative AI Works"></a>How Generative AI Works</h2><p> The working mechanism of a generative AI model involves a complex interplay of various deep-learning techniques and algorithms. The exact details of how a generative model works depend on its goals and the underlying architecture. For instance, a generative model for generating audio snippets will have a different working mechanism from one meant for generating videos or text.</p><p> However, at their core, most, if not all, generative models work similarly at their foundational level. They learn from a large amount of data, capture patterns and styles of the data, and then use these captured patterns to reproduce samples akin to what they’ve learned in their training data.</p><p> You can think of generative AI tools as a music composer. Imagine this music composer has listened to countless songs and studied the harmonies, melodies, rhythms, and structures of a number of musical genres. In other words, this composer has an extensive knowledge of the musical genres. With this knowledge, the composer can create original or unique music inspired by what they have learned.</p><p> So if they’ve learned a lot about pop music, you could ask them to compose a pop song, and they won’t have a problem doing so. The composed music would then be an expression of the composer’s understanding of what pop music should look like based on what they’ve learned. Similarly, the product of generative AI is an expression of the AI model’s understanding of the underlying concepts learned from its training data.</p><p> So if you want to create a generative AI model that generates pictures of cars, you’d have to feed the model a huge dataset of car images. To create an impressive model, you’d need to feed it pictures of as many car brands and models as you can think of. With enough training, the algorithm will learn what each car brand or model looks like, and we’ll be able to create images of almost any car you can think of on demand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Popular-Generative-AI-Models"><a href="#Popular-Generative-AI-Models" class="headerlink" title="Popular Generative AI Models"></a>Popular Generative AI Models</h2><p> There are hundreds of generative AI models currently in development or already being deployed in the consumer AI market.

Despite being OpenAI’s CEO, Altman was relatively unknown in the larger internet community, and his tweet came with little to no fanfare.</p><p> Five days later, ChatGPT had gathered its first one million users; it did so at a rate unheard of by any app. It gathered several million more, eventually <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-became-fastest-growing-app/" >making ChatGPT the fastest-growing app of all time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While ChatGPT is not the first generative AI product, its arrival on the AI product scene brought generative AI into public consciousness more than any other tech product before it.</p><p> While ChatGPT has been the tip of the spear in propelling the hype around generative AI, it didn’t do it alone. 2022 will be remembered as the year generative AI tools went mainstream. From conversational AI chatbots to code and art generators, the second half of 2022 was the first time multiple AI tools that had both mass appeal and practical day-to-day uses had hit the market. With these tools came the popularity of its underlying technology—generative AI.</p><p> Generative AI tools such as Bing AI, Google’s Bard, DALL-E, ChatGPT, and Midjourney have seamlessly woven themselves into the fabric of our daily lives, constantly presenting us with their remarkable creations. Whether it’s the captivating write-ups crafted by ChatGPT or the astonishingly lifelike images conjured by Midjourney, generative AI has become an ever-present companion, accompanying us day in and day out.

But why stop at the preparation stage? You can have this AI language model open on the side during the entire meeting to ask questions and come up with new ideas.</p><p><strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> ChatGPT can even help with post-meeting tasks and streamline things for any future meetings. Let’s look at the different ways you can leverage ChatGPT’s language model for your next virtual team meeting:</p><h2 id="1-Anticipate-Questions-in-Advance"><a href="#1-Anticipate-Questions-in-Advance" class="headerlink" title="1. Anticipate Questions in Advance"></a>1. Anticipate Questions in Advance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anticipating-questions-in-advance-using-chatgpt.jpeg"                      alt="ChatGPT answering the prompt &quot;Give me a list of questions that may be asked during a meeting between the project management department and the health and safety department discussing the installation of a new injection moulding machine&quot;"                ></p><p> Being in a virtual meeting can be more stressful than a physical one as the interactions are limited. Also, you cannot easily read the body language of others. So, when someone asks a question that you didn’t expect, your whole presentation can go off the rails.</p><p> Thankfully, ChatGPT is the perfect tool for anticipating most of the questions you may be asked during a virtual meeting. You only have to provide the necessary details, such as the meeting’s agenda, your role, and topics of discussion.</p><p> Once you have provided this information, simply ask ChatGPT to generate a list of questions the attendees might ask during the virtual session. The language model can even provide answers to these potential questions.</p><p> While these responses may not be the best, they can serve as a great starting point for your preparation. Then, with the questions and potential responses in hand, you can organize them further in any note-taking app.</p><h2 id="2-Brainstorm-Ideas"><a href="#2-Brainstorm-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="2. Brainstorm Ideas"></a>2.

For example, you can open the AI in another window and ask it to provide intuitive suggestions about the topics under discussion. These ideas can then be passed to the meeting members, and everyone can discuss their viability.</p><p> ChatGPT can help provide a new angle that may solve the issue more efficiently. It can also provide a good starting point for your team to come up with fresh new ideas of their own.

Understanding the basics of AI and how it works will help you know its strengths and limitations, as well as how to use it to thrive in your workplace.</p><p> In simple terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computer systems to simulate human intelligence and carry out a wide range of tasks. Some of the most common use cases of AI in the workplace include automating hiring processes, optimizing customer service, inventory management, or data collection and analysis, to name a few.</p><p> Although AI systems have been used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and sales for quite some time, their use is increasing exponentially due to technological advancements and the release of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT.</p><p> ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that relies on vast amounts of training data to generate natural-sounding text. This AI chatbot is used for tasks such as content creation, programming, and translation, to name a few. In fact, this tool is so good that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-replace-me/" >people wonder if generative AI will take over their jobs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="2-Know-the-Difference-Between-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Human-Intelligence"><a href="#2-Know-the-Difference-Between-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Human-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="2.

Human intelligence relies on cognitive processes like perception, problem-solving, memory, and creativity. It can be limited by factors like the amount of information available or one’s ability to recall information, cognitive biases, and limited attention spans.</p><p> Although humans and artificial intelligence use data to solve problems, AI relies on complex algorithms to process and analyze vast amounts of data at a higher pace without getting tired. AI-powered systems also have limited capabilities, as they rely on the set of instructions and the data fed into their systems to carry out tasks.</p><p> On the other hand, humans possess the unique ability to use their senses and emotions and apply knowledge and logic in creative ways to solve complex problems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Develop-Skills-AI-Can’t-Replicate"><a href="#3-Develop-Skills-AI-Can’t-Replicate" class="headerlink" title="3.

Although Wonderplan doesn’t show the trip map, it does provide a link to Google Maps for each place.</p><p> It also displays different types of accommodation available (like Airbnb, hotel, or hostel) and their respective costs.

As far as we checked, iplan.ai works best for popular tourist cities, not offbeat or obscure travel. Next, note how many days you will be there, and then choose your free time each day—a cool step to ensure a better itinerary if you already have some plans, but not a whole days worth.</p><p> Tell iplan.ai if you’re traveling solo, as a couple, with family, or with friends, and then choose your interest among topics like history, art and culture, nature, entertainment, shopping, food, sports, relaxing, etc. Finally, choose between an economy, normal, or luxury budget.</p><p> After a few minutes, iplan.ai gives you a day-wise itinerary for your trip. It’s plotted on a map so you can see all the locations, and each point of interest has a brief description along with estimated travel time.</p><p> The app has both free and paid plans. With a paid account, you can share the trip plan with your friends and access it offline. Another limitation of iplan.ai is that you can’t get an itinerary for a multi-city trip. For now, you’ll need to make a plan for each city you’re visiting, one at a time.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> iplan.ai for <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2021804/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.iplan.app" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> | <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/iplan-ai-travel-planner/id1611716564" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, Paid)</p><h2 id="5-Curiosio"><a href="#5-Curiosio" class="headerlink" title="5.

Curiosio specializes in helping you plan an itinerary for a road trip to several major countries on all continents. It doesn’t cover every single place, but the existing collection is impressive enough.</p><p> Curiosio uses its own AI engine, Ingeenee, which is trained on several crowdsourced travel-based resources, such as Wikivoyage, Wikipedia, Wikidata, Freebase, DBpedia, GeoNames, OSMNames, and OpenStreetMap. Through this dataset, it can chart an itinerary that meets your requirements across various parameters.</p><p> You can set options for a round trip or a one-way trip with starting and finishing points. If there are any places you want to visit on the way, add them in. Then set the number of travelers, dates of the journey, what vehicle you’re using, total budget, and whether you want to visit places that spark curiosity or are obscure. The AI will usually give you multiple plans and routes for these options.</p><p> The itinerary includes a map of your route and a day-wise breakdown of where you’ll be going and what you’ll be seeing. Each point of interest is clickable to find more information about it. There are easy ways to share your itinerary with co-travelers, print it out, or even export it to Google Maps.

Trip Planner AI asks you about your dietary preferences and budget.</p><p> As an optional step, you can specify the place where you’ll be staying so that it creates an itinerary accordingly. If you haven’t decided on your lodging yet, you can explore hotels suggested by Trip Planner AI.</p><p> Finally, Trip Planner AI generates a detailed itinerary, a map, and basic information about the city you’re visiting.

So, you can ask it to give travel recommendations, compare different destinations, and, of course, create an itinerary. If you’ve previously used AI chatbots like ChatGPT, you’ll find this trip planner easy to use.</p><p> Just enter a prompt specifying your destination and trip details and ask Vacay Chatbot to create an itinerary. You can include details like your trip duration, budget, preferences, number of travelers, etc. The more details you provide, the better your itinerary will be.</p><p> One of the downsides of using Vacay Chatbot is that it doesn’t provide a map for your trip.

So, with the arrival of Claude Pro, how does Claude Pro compare to ChatGPT Plus?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Claude-Pro-3"><a href="#What-Is-Claude-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Claude Pro?"></a>What Is Claude Pro?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-of-claude-pro-banner-from-claude-website.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of Claude Pro banner from Claude Website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image credit: <a class="link"   href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-pro" >Anthropic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Claude Pro is the premium subscription tier of Claude AI. It offers a range of improvements to the free-to-use version of the Claude AI chatbot. Billed at $20 per month, Claude Pro is similarly priced to other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. It uses Anthropic’s latest Claude 2 language model and is currently available to users in the US and the UK. Of course, with a few tricks and a VPN, you can sign up for Claude Pro and use it in any country.</p><p> Claude AI’s free tier is already enjoying massive adoption. The AI chatbot is clocking millions of monthly users despite being limited to only two countries. It is evidently good enough to be adopted by large companies like Quora, who have made it available on their Poe AI platform.</p><p> But there’s an interesting twist. ChatGPT and Claude AI take different approaches to their free and paid tiers. With ChatGPT, the free tier is limited to GPT-3.5, while paid users get access to both GPT-3.5 and the more advanced GPT-4. Claude AI, on the other hand, uses the same Claude 2 model for both its free and paid tiers. So, what’s the incentive to go Pro with Claude?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Is-Claude-Pro-Different-from-Claude-3"><a href="#How-Is-Claude-Pro-Different-from-Claude-3" class="headerlink" title="How Is Claude Pro Different from Claude?"></a>How Is Claude Pro Different from Claude?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ai-art-from-claude-website.jpg"                      alt="AI art from Claude website"                ></p><p>image credit: Anthropic</p><p> If you are a frequent Claude AI user, there’s a good chance you’ve run into usage limits. This hardly ever happened in the early days of the free tier, but it seems to be happening more often.</p><p> It’s not entirely clear whether this is a result of increased usage as more users join or intentional restrictions aimed at pushing users to paid plans. Irrespective of the reason, the paid tier promises to solve this problem by increasing the usage limit to as much as five times what the free tier offers.</p><p> For power users who want to avoid disruptions and delays, the expanded usage quota incentivizes upgrading to Claude Pro. The paid tier enables productive reliance on Claude AI regardless of traffic spikes or any intentional limitations of the free version.</p><p> Also, like ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro promises early access to new features and updates. But beyond this and a few more usage options, the differences between the free and paid tiers are not very pronounced right now. However, just like ChatGPT Plus, we expect Anthropic to make progressive and incremental changes to Claude Pro over time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-Does-Claude-Pro-Cost-3"><a href="#How-Much-Does-Claude-Pro-Cost-3" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does Claude Pro Cost?"></a>How Much Does Claude Pro Cost?</h2><p> Like ChatGPT Plus, a Claude Pro subscription will set you back $20 per month (£18 in the UK).

In fact, beyond sheer model capabilities and ChatGPT’s use of plugins, there are several <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-claude-ai-chatbot-better-than-chatgpt/" >ways that Claude AI outperforms ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> One of the most important advantages of the Claude AI model is its significantly larger context window, which currently stands at around 100,000 tokens, a far cry from ChatGPT’s average 4,096 token context window.</p><p> This means Claude can handle many more input and output variables in a conversation than you can do with ChatGPT Plus. Also, while ChatGPT’s GPT-4 model has message caps ranging between 25 and 200 messages per three hours, you’ll find Claude Pro significantly more generous. There’s a good chance that you might never run into the message caps on Claude Pro, even if you are among the heaviest users of the service.</p><p> For a general sense of how ChatGPT and Claude AI compare, you can check out this <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-claude-ai/" >detailed comparison of ChatGPT and Claude AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Claude-Pro-Is-Welcomed-Competition-3"><a href="#Claude-Pro-Is-Welcomed-Competition-3" class="headerlink" title="Claude Pro Is Welcomed Competition"></a>Claude Pro Is Welcomed Competition</h2><p> Anthropic’s Claude Pro subscription plan may not be the most value-packed offering in the AI chatbot market, but it has immense potential.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Behind-the-Scenes-Generative-AI’s-Functioning-Corporate-Implementations"><a href="#Behind-the-Scenes-Generative-AI’s-Functioning-Corporate-Implementations" class="headerlink" title="Behind the Scenes: Generative AI’s Functioning &amp; Corporate Implementations"></a>Behind the Scenes: Generative AI’s Functioning &amp; Corporate Implementations</h2><p> Generative AI is all the rage these days. Many useful applications of AI have started to pop up, from art creation to pretty much anything you can think of. There is one specific application that’s going big, though. So big, in fact, that Big Tech companies have started to jump on it.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> We’re talking, of course, about AI chats and searching. But what exactly is generative AI search, and which companies are using it?</p><h2 id="What-Is-Generative-AI-Search"><a href="#What-Is-Generative-AI-Search" class="headerlink" title="What Is Generative AI Search?"></a>What Is Generative AI Search?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/best-ai-web-apps.jpg"                      alt="OpenAI logo up-close on a phone"                ></p><p> First off, we need to explain what generative AI search is. You’re probably familiar with the concept of generative AI—it’s a type of artificial intelligence that can generate content for you, from images to text, to music, and everything in between. It started catching on in late 2021 to early 2022, but it’s matured to the point it can do some really amazing—and occasionally creepy—things.</p><p> But generative AI search is a proposition that, once it matures, can be greatly useful to users. Basically, it’s like a search engine that can give you concise answers to questions generated by artificial intelligence based on the pool of knowledge that specific AI has access to. It can parse concise user questions and try to come up with answers that will be useful without necessarily linking to a website or portal.</p><p> In a way, this is pretty much <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/" >the same way ChatGPT works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Right now, you can pull up ChatGPT and ask it questions. For example, you can ask it to whip up a recipe with a number of ingredients, or you can ask it for complicated questions about the ins and outs of chemistry.</p><p> But generative AI search aims to use that kind of output generation to replace all, or most, of the currently searched queries through regular search engines. And it aims to do a lot more. It’s, essentially, putting the capabilities of ChatGPT, and all its power, at the fingertips of most regular users.</p><h2 id="How-Is-Generative-AI-Search-Different-From-Regular-Search"><a href="#How-Is-Generative-AI-Search-Different-From-Regular-Search" class="headerlink" title="How Is Generative AI Search Different From Regular Search?"></a>How Is Generative AI Search Different From Regular Search?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/openai-chatgpt-logo-on-code-background-feature.jpg"                      alt="openai chatgpt logo on code background"                ></p><p> There are a few ways in which generative AI search is vastly different from regular search.</p><p> Right now, if you pull up Google and enter a search term, it’ll return a number of search results of different things it found through the internet matching your search. Search engines in their current state are, essentially, directories of websites. They do the best job possible at indexing billions of websites and looking through each and every one of them to give you the exact one you’re looking for.</p><p> Search engines are neat. They’ve been improved over the years, so it’s even easier to search for specific information, and the results are not just a blank, boring-looking list of websites. For one, if you’re asking it a question, it may pull up a quote from a website in an attempt to answer that question. And if you look up a company, place, or celebrity, it’ll pull up a side panel with condensed information about what or who it is, and links to find more information.</p><p> Generative AI search wants to be the next step forward in this direction. Instead of pulling up millions of search results, your query gets fed through an AI that will try to help you the best way it can. If you have a question, it’ll pull up information from its pool of knowledge to answer it, and if you want it to help you out with something, it will try and do so to the best of its ability. Basically, it’s ChatGPT, except it looks like a browser.</p><p> It has a few challenges ahead, and it might not replace regular search engines entirely as they will still have their purpose, but it might become a nice compliment that will make them way more useful whenever the technology is mature and released.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-Companies-Are-Using-Generative-AI-Search"><a href="#Which-Companies-Are-Using-Generative-AI-Search" class="headerlink" title="Which Companies Are Using Generative AI Search?"></a>Which Companies Are Using Generative AI Search?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/microsoft-building.jpg"                      alt="microsoft building with logo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Right now, the generative AI search battle is being fought between Google and Microsoft.</p><p> Microsoft announced the release of “<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-bing-gets-chatgpt-ai/" >the new Bing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,” a new version of the company’s search engine that will provide you not only with the regular Bing search experience but also with a complimentary, ChatGPT-like window where you can ask “real questions” and get “complete answers.” You can ask it for help with your daily life, or just simple questions that you might or might not find using regular Bing.</p><p> In addition, “the new Microsoft Edge” is a revamped version of Microsoft’s browser with this AI technology built in. So instead of heading over to the Bing browser, you can pull up a sidebar in Edge where you can input whatever you want the AI to help you with. It can come in handy if, for example, you’re writing an email and struggling to find the right words.</p><p> Google, on the other hand, is also coming up with new AI features of its own. Google launched its <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/google-launching-bard-ai-compete-with-chatgpt/" >ChatGPT-like chatbot called Bard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but eventually, the company wants to bring AI features into its main products as well. This includes the company’s regular search experience, where AI-generated answers will complement, not replace, regular search results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-Will-I-Be-Able-to-Use-Generative-AI-Search"><a href="#When-Will-I-Be-Able-to-Use-Generative-AI-Search" class="headerlink" title="When Will I Be Able to Use Generative AI Search?"></a>When Will I Be Able to Use Generative AI Search?</h2><p> Right now, you’re able to play around with ChatGPT.

But it’s a fun product to play around with.</p><p> As for actual AI-powered search engines, you can now join the waitlist for “the new Bing” at Microsoft’s website. As for Google, there’s no waitlist, but the company might eventually open up its work on AI sometime over the next few months.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Generative AI Search is Great<p> Generative AI search still needs work to become truly useful, but it is already a promising prospect.
