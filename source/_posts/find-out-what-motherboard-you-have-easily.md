 Driver Easy can also help you update drivers for your motherboard and other components. It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know what hardware you’re using, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, and you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only**2** clicks (and you get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

**1)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**2)** Click the **Update**  button next to each of your devices to download the latest and correct driver for it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
