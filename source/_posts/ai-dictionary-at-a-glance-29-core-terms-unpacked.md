Hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, and the number of hidden layers in the network. You can tinker with these parameters to fine-tune the model's performance according to your needs.

## 17\. Large Language Model (LLM)

 An LLM is a machine learning model trained on vast amounts of data and uses supervised learning to produce the next token in a given context to produce meaningful, contextual responses to user inputs. The word "large" indicates the use of extensive parameters by the language model. For example, [GPT models use hundreds of billions of parameters](http://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-models-explained-and-compared/) to carry out a wide range of NLP tasks.

## 18\. Machine Learning

[Machine learning](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/machine-learning-algorithms/) is a way for machines to learn and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It's like feeding a computer with data and empowering it to make decisions or predictions by identifying patterns within the data.

## 19\. Neural Network

 A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized in layers. Each neuron receives input from other neurons in the network, allowing it to learn patterns and make decisions. Neural networks are a key component in machine learning models that enable them to excel in a wide array of tasks.

## 20\. Natural Language Generation (NLG)

 Natural language generation deals with the creation of human-readable text from structured data. NLG finds applications in content creation, chatbots, and voice assistants.

## 21\. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

[Natural language processing](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/) is the ability of machines to interpret, understand, and respond to human-readable text or speech. It's used in various applications, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question answering.

## 22\. OpenAI

![openai logo on black screen](https://thmb.techidaily.com/fe5fb2202d31ead27c9d026582d857fbe91d9882cc06bf2431577eb2dc90df03.jpg)

 OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research laboratory, founded in 2015 and based in San Francisco, USA. The company develops and deploys AI tools that can appear to be as smart as humans. OpenAI's best-known product, ChatGPT, was released in November 2022 and is heralded as the most advanced chatbot for its ability to provide answers on a wide range of topics.

## 26\. Supervised Learning

 A machine learning method where the model is trained using labeled data with the desired output. The model generalizes from the labeled data and makes accurate predictions on new data.

## 27\. Tokenization

 Tokenization is the process of splitting a text document into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can represent words, numbers, phrases, symbols, or any elements in text that a program can work with. The purpose of tokenization is to make the most sense out of unstructured data without processing the entire text as a single string, which is computationally inefficient and difficult to model.

## 28\. Turing Test

 Introduced by Alan Turing in 1950, this test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligence indistinguishable from that of a human. The [Turing test](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-turing-test-ever-beaten/) involves a human judge interacting with a human and a machine without knowing which is which. If the judge fails to distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is considered to have passed the test.

## 29\. Unsupervised Learning

 A machine learning method where the model makes inferences from unlabeled datasets. It discovers patterns in the data to make predictions on unseen data.

## Embracing the Language of Artificial Intelligence

 AI is a rapidly evolving field changing how we interact with technology. However, with so many new buzzwords constantly emerging, it can be hard to keep up with the latest developments in the field.

 While some terms may seem abstract without context, their significance becomes clear when combined with a basic understanding of machine learning. Understanding these terms and concepts can lay a powerful foundation that will empower you to make informed decisions within the realm of artificial intelligence.
