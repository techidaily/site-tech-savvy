## Affordable Boost Mobile 5G Plans Now Available

Boost Mobile is one of the most popular MVNO mobile carriers in the United States, and more recently, it has been under the ownership of Dish Network. Now, Dish is consolidating Boost and revamping its mobile plans.

[Boost Mobile](https://boostmobile.sjv.io/c/156932/1330603/16069?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2004227&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2F) has revamped its mobile plans, and now offers both prepaid and postpaid plans, so you can pick the option that makes the most sense for you. Boost claims that it’s now “the only nationwide carrier with both prepaid and postpaid mobile services under one name,” though that’s more of a distinction without a difference: whether you get an AT&T plan or an AT&T Prepaid plan, you’re dealing with the same company, stores, and support.

 Boost Unlimited now has three primary mobile plans. The first is $25/month Unlimited, which gets you “unlimited talk, text and premium, high speed data,” though your high-speed data is capped at 30GB, there is no tethering, and taxes are not included. There’s also a $50/mo Unlimited+ plan, which adds mobile hotspot connectivity, more international roaming, savings on new devices, and bumps up the high-speed data to 40GB. Finally, the $60/mo Unlimited Premium plan has 50GB of high-speed data and more potential savings on phone purchases.

 There are also “Infinite Access for iPhone” and “Infinite Access for Galaxy” plans, which include “up to $830” savings on a new iPhone and “up to $800” savings on a new Samsung Galaxy phone each year, respectively. Those are Boost’s most expensive plans, at $65/month, and you still have to pay taxes on top of that.

 The pricing for all of Boost Mobile’s plans factor in a $5/mo AutoPay discount. For example, if you paid for your Unlimited plan manually instead of automatic payments from a supported bank account or card, it would be $30/mo instead of $25/mo.

 Boost claims the new plans have “simplified pricing,” because the per-line cost is identical no matter how many lines you have, unlike some other carriers. However, with some plans including taxes and some not including taxes, “simplified” probably isn’t a good descriptor. As always with mobile networks, you should read all the fine print if you choose one of these plans.

 Dish is also killing off [Boost Infinite](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ltimate-guide-to-the-top-5-youtube-link-reducers/) (formerly Project Genesis), the company’s post-paid wireless service that was used as a testing ground for its [own home-built 5G network](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/grid-layout-geniuses-for-photo-perfection-for-2024/). Boost Infinite’s “Infinite Access” plans and all its current subscribers have been moved over to regular Boost Mobile, and Dish’s 5G towers have been available to Boost Mobile subscribers for a while already. Boost Mobile still primarily uses T-Mobile’s network, but Dish’s network and AT&T are used in some areas.

 You can [sign up for Boost Mobile](https://boostmobile.sjv.io/c/156932/1330603/16069?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2004227&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fplans) from the company’s website or from one of the company’s physical retail stores.
