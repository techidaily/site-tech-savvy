## AI's Role in DIY Expanding Preemptively

 Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, and OpenAI's GPT-4 is set to be the next big thing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The text generation language modelâ€™s current version, GPT-3.5, has surpassed peopleâ€™s expectations with conversational capabilities ranging from chat companionship to code generation.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 It is public information that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is developing GPT-4, 3.5â€™s successor. Upcoming model details are undisclosed, but it's speculated to be a more robust and capable version.

 Cloud-based data analysis by GPT-4, integrated with microcontroller-based platforms like Arduino, will offer DIYers a more productive approach to product development.

## Multi-Modal AI and DIY: What Is a Multi-Modal AI?

 Multi-modal AI refers to AI models that can process and understand different types of data, such as text, images, and videos. Get this, if GPT-4 becomes a multi-modal AI, it will be a game changer for DIY enthusiasts.

 This means that GPT-4 could potentially generate DIY project ideas based on visual input, such as a user's uploaded images of materials or finished projects.

 It could also provide step-by-step instructions that incorporate both text and visual cues, making it easier for users to follow along. With multi-modal capabilities, GPT-4 could open up a whole new world of possibilities for DIY enthusiasts looking to take on more complex projects.

## How Will GPT-4 Speed Up DIY Development?
