 So, here are the best custom GPTs that actually make ChatGPT a better tool for any situation.

## 9 Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant by Rogan Keel

 Walking into the gym for the first time can be incredibly daunting, especially if you know little or nothing about fitness. Creating a program is also difficult; I still vividly remember spending hours on bodybuilding forums when I first began training in 2014\. Fortunately, getting the information you need is much easier these days—and Rogan Keel’s Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant is a helpful custom GPT for new gym-goers.

 To use this GPT more effectively, make sure you give it as much information as possible. For example, I gave it my story of what my health condition was like when I first wanted to go to the gym and mentioned dietary requirements. You should also mention how many days you’d like to exercise per week. After giving the assistant all the required information, you’ll get an overview of your diet and exercise regimen.

 Although Math Solver is good for understanding how to solve mathematical problems, you shouldn’t use it to cheat on your homework or exams. In fact, there are many [ways that you should not use ChatGPT as a student](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-not-use-student/)—such as relying on the program to write essays for you.

## 5 Travel Guide

 Do you have a big upcoming trip, or are you simply researching potential adventures? Consider using the Travel Guide GPT plugin to help you gather essential information and plan your itinerary.

 Travel Guide is pretty good at providing an itinerary outline for you to build upon later. For example, you can use the days it gives you and then do extra research elsewhere for places to eat, where to stay, etc.

 Besides planning itineraries, Travel Guide can offer budget travel tips for specific destinations. For example, we asked the Travel Guide GPT to help us visit Switzerland on a budget of 80 Swiss Francs (c. $88 per day), excluding hotels.

## 9 Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant by Rogan Keel

 Walking into the gym for the first time can be incredibly daunting, especially if you know little or nothing about fitness. Creating a program is also difficult; I still vividly remember spending hours on bodybuilding forums when I first began training in 2014\. Fortunately, getting the information you need is much easier these days—and Rogan Keel’s Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant is a helpful custom GPT for new gym-goers.

 To use this GPT more effectively, make sure you give it as much information as possible. For example, I gave it my story of what my health condition was like when I first wanted to go to the gym and mentioned dietary requirements. You should also mention how many days you’d like to exercise per week. After giving the assistant all the required information, you’ll get an overview of your diet and exercise regimen.
