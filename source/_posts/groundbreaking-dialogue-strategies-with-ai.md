## 1\. Analyze a Token

* **Prompt**: I'm a crypto investor. I came across a new token that's gaining traction. It's called "Theta Token." Can you help me analyze the utility and value proposition of the token and its underlying blockchain? Describe its key features, use cases, and any unique characteristics that set it apart from other tokens in the market. Additionally, discuss its performance trends over the past six months, considering factors such as market capitalization, trading volume, and community engagement. Provide insights into the token's potential for growth and any challenges it may face in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Break down the analysis into sections for easy reading.
* **Result**:

 There are thousands of crypto tokens listed on CoinMarketCap. Analyzing these tokens can be challenging. But you can simplify research with ChatGPT Plus, which allows you to use [ChatGPT crypto plugins](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-crypto-chatgpt-plugins/) to access the latest real-time data.

Help me develop a strategy for the top 10 cryptocurrencies focusing on risk management and maximizing profit potential. Please provide a clear plan that outlines:  
  * Key technical indicators and chart patterns for identifying entry and exit points

 Whenever you want to upgrade your skills, you easily get overwhelmed with every detail you must consider. In this case, the prompt will help you narrow down these details, so you can focus on the most important aspects.

## 3\. Summarize a Whitepaper

* **Prompt**: Assume I am an 18-year-old with basic computer knowledge. I want to understand Bitcoin's whitepaper. Summarize the key concepts and innovations presented in the paper in an easy-to-read manner. Provide a concise overview of the objectives, technology, and problems it aims to solve. Describe how Bitcoin is intended to be used and how different it is from government currencies and other cryptocurrencies. Ensure the summary is accurate and avoids any ambiguity.
* **Result**:  
![Screesnhot of ChatGPT Summarizing a Whitepaper](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/summarizing-a-whitepaper.jpg)

 With many crypto projects in the market, you don't want to spend thousands of hours going through endless whitepapers. Use this prompt to summarize any crypto whitepaper and get a quick, firm grasp of what the project entails.

## 4\. Review Smart Contracts

 Note that for the following, we tested the source code of a [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa7ca36f7273d4d38fc2aec5a454c497f86728a7a#code) listed on Etherscan.

 This is perhaps one of the most ingenious ways to use ChatGPT in crypto. Considering the many scams in the industry, it's wise to complete a technical analysis of every smart contract you wish to use or participate in. Paste the smart contract into ChatGPT and let it tell you if it's malicious.

## 5\. Get Crypto Terms Explanations

 The cryptocurrency industry is fast evolving. A few years back, we thought Bitcoin's only use was as a store of value and currency. Today courtesy of [Bitcoin ordinals](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-how-differ-from-nfts/), Bitcoin can now support NFTs. Often, you'll come across many such crypto terms that need some explaining, and this prompt helps you to understand them better.

## 6\. Make Investment Strategies

* **Prompt**: I'm interested in earning passive income, and I've opted to invest in crypto staking. Currently, which cryptocurrencies are most secure and offer the most attractive returns?

I would also like to know the minimum requirements to participate in these programs and any associated fees. Break down the analysis for easy reading.

## ChatGPT Crypto Prompts Are Like Cheat Codes

 ChatGPT crypto prompts can be likened to cheat codes. They significantly reduce the time and effort you need to become informed. In this age, promptly getting the most important information is crucial. Hence, using the power of ChatGPT to make your crypto journey more enjoyable is a wise move.

 But please note that using ChatGPT for crypto analysis is just one part of the puzzle. You shouldn't rely on ChatGPT for analysis because of its limited dataset and its well-documented issues with hallucination. Furthermore, nothing replaces the research you should do before investing any money in crypto!

 ​The information on this website does not constitute financial advice, investment advice, or trading advice, and should not be considered as such. MakeUseOf does not advise on any trading or investing matters and does not advise that any particular cryptocurrency should be bought or sold. Always conduct your own due diligence and consult a licensed financial adviser for investment advice.
