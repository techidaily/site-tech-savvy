## 1\. Draw Your Outline Without ChatGPT

![Outline of an essay on the history of German Shepherds](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/outline-of-an-essay-on-the-history-of-german-shepherds.jpeg)

 Assuming you already have an idea for your project, the first thing you should do before you hop on ChatGPT’s website is to prepare your thesis and outline without using AI. It’s a vital step to making sure the core of your essay actually comes from you.

 If you use ChatGPT to prompt an outline for you, it could promote idea laziness, and you will find ChatGPT’s suggestions may have replaced the ones you could have produced on your own. So, get a piece of paper or a blank word processor page and create an outline for your essay.

 Also, ChatGPT will avoid controversial topics—even in an outline. Therefore, you might find yourself with an outline missing vital pieces of historical sections if you rely on it. This bias is one of the [major problems with OpenAI’s ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/).

## 2\. Prompt ChatGPT to Draw a Parallel Outline

 Before you begin this section, if this is your first time using ChatGPT, you should read our guide on [how to use ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/). It will help you with creating an account and defining its capabilities. Once that’s out of the way, you can move on to the next step.

 Now that you have an original outline, it doesn’t matter how basic it looks; you can use ChatGPT to create another outline. Craft a prompt with this template:

`Create a detailed outline for an essay on <insert your essay topic here>.`

![ChatGPT's outline on the essay on the history of German Shepherds](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-s-outline-on-the-essay-on-the-history-of-german-shepherds.jpeg)

 ChatGPT’s result is far more detailed than our outline. Here, you should adopt the parts of ChatGPT’s outline you would like to integrate into your own. Combine the best of the two and flesh out an outline that will guide you best as you write.

## 3\. Create a ChatGPT Prompt for Each Section

 Now that you have an outline with sections, you can begin to hack away at it section by section. Start with your introduction, where you will include your thesis statement. Ask ChatGPT to create multiple thesis statements on your idea, and choose the one that best encapsulates the major point you’re trying to communicate in your essay.

 You can do something similar for all the other sections as well. Tell the AI to generate written pieces on your section topics. Don’t forget to add that it communicates the point in the tone you want. In most cases, essays should sound academic. Therefore, our prompt for each section looked like this:

`Write a 500-word piece on the Phylax Society and the impact it had on the German Shepherd breed using an academic style.`

 Do not just copy and paste the information it generates; the next step is a vital second part of this methodology.

## 4\. Confirm the Information With a Reputable Source

 As you begin to write, you must check if the information you’re getting from ChatGPT is indeed correct. You must do this because [ChatGPT occasionally hallucinates](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/), coming up with its own facts and making up sources when you ask it to direct you to where it got its information. In some cases, it blatantly refuses to tell you at all where it got its data.

![ChatGPT refusing to cite its sources for its information](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-refusing-to-cite-its-sources-for-its-information.jpeg)

 The free version of ChatGPT is not actively connected to the internet and cannot fetch information after September 2021\. If you need this functionality, then it could be time to [upgrade to ChatGPT Plus](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-should-upgrade-chatgpt-plus/)—especially if this is a tool you will be using heavily for work or school.

 The bottom line is that you should use a reputable source (such as a book from an authority or an official website) to support every important statement you put down. You can also learn how to [use Google to fact-check information](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-fact-check-information/).

## 5\. Use ChatGPT for Examples and Breakdowns

 It’s counterproductive to write about ideas that you don’t even understand yourself. When you reach a part of your essay that you don’t properly understand, you should go to ChatGPT and have it broken down for you.

 That’s really the one thing you can count on ChatGPT to do in this process. It has good skill in crafting useful examples and explaining complicated ideas in a form you can easily understand. A popular way of phrasing a prompt to make ChatGPT explain something complicated is adding “explain like I’m five” to your prompt.

![ChatGPT explaining German Shepher's hip and elbow dysplasia](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-explaining-german-shepher-s-hip-and-elbow-dysplasia.jpeg)

	<div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>

 Here we used ChatGPT to break down hip and elbow dysplasia conditions in a way that is easier to understand. And it used analogies like jigsaw puzzles to paint a clearer image of what it might look like.

## 6\. Write the Essay Yourself

 As we’ve stated earlier, under no condition should you ask ChatGPT to write your whole essay for you. Not only is that lazy and deceitful, but it could also open you up to plagiarism and submitting incorrect information.

 Ensure that every line in your essay is typed with your hands. Besides, if you’re writing an academic essay where you must cite sources, you will still need to corroborate all the points you’ve made with a corresponding authority. That means you’ll have to go and fact-check everything ChatGPT has written and find a corroborating source.

 This could even take more time than just writing it yourself because the AI could have hallucinated some of its facts, leading you on a wild goose chase as you try to find a citation for something that doesn’t exist.

 Lastly, ChatGPT doesn’t match the nuanced knowledge of a human professional in heavily specialized fields or journals that need up-to-date information. Reading a book or article by an expert, internalizing it, and writing it in your own words will give you far better results than relying on ChatGPT.

## 7\. Polish the Style and Citation With ChatGPT

 After writing, you can paste portions of your essay and ask ChatGPT to shorten, lengthen, or optimize the style. ChatGPT is good at mimicking popular styles, and you can use that to your advantage. If you want your writing to sound a little more professional, it can help rephrase it.

![ChatGPT showing the user how to add citations to their essay](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-showing-the-user-how-to-add-citations-to-their-essay.jpeg)

 If you’re having trouble with citation styles and how to integrate them into your essay, you can present your essay to ChatGPT, give it your sources, and ask it to weld them together for you.

## ChatGPT Is a Tool, Not a Solution

 You can’t “ChatGPT” away academic or professional work; you must use it the same way you would use a tool. Take a calculator, for instance; it doesn’t replace the mathematician but improves the mathematician. You should use ChatGPT the same way a mathematician will use a calculator: for the boring, repetitive, rote work.

 Let the ideas and story come from you and your experiences. And if you want to keep using ChatGPT as a student, make sure you know what you shouldn't do.
