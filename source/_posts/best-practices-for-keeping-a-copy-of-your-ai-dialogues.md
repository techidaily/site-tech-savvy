 Processing the data export can take some time, depending on how much data you have. Once your data is ready, a download link will be sent to your email address. The link to the data export download expires 24 hours after you receive it, so be sure to download it within that time frame.

 Upon extraction, you will find an HTML file with your conversation logs. You will also get a JSON version of your conversation logs and account information. The HTML file can be viewed in a browser, while the JSON files can be accessed and read using any text editor. The information included in your export includes:
