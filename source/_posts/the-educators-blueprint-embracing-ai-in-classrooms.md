## The Educator's Blueprint: Embracing AI in Classrooms

 With students using AI writing tools and chatbots to cheat, schools have become wary of them. Many institutions even banned ChatGPT altogether.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 While itâ€™s reasonable for educators to feel threatened by AI tools, please note that they also yield several advantages. Itâ€™s hasty and careless to ban AI. Here are some ways how students and teachers could benefit from AI tools.

## 1\. AI Detects AI-Generated Text

![GPTZero Detecting AI-Generated Text](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gptzero-trial-text-detection.jpg)

 Letâ€™s face itâ€”schools canâ€™t actually ban [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Even if AI sites are blocked on campus networks, students can access them on their gadgets. Theyâ€™ll still cheat on their homework.

 Instead of attempting to stop students from using AI tools like ChatGPT, educators should find ways to spot AI-generated content efficiently. Consider using [AI text detectors](https://www.makeuseof.com/accurate-ai-text-detectors/). Advanced AI models like GPT-4, which powers chatbots like [Bing Chat](http://www.bing.com/) and ChatGPT Plus, produce natural, human-like text thatâ€™s almost indistinguishable.

 Yes, AI text detectors are still flawed. But widely trusted options like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/) and [OpenAIâ€™s Text Classifier](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier) demonstrate relatively reliable results. You can at least use them to detect possible cheaters. Only quiz students yourself if their paper seems suspicious; that way, you donâ€™t have to investigate everyone taking your classes.

## 2\. Text-To-Image Generators Spark Creativity

![AI-Generated Image of Girl Playing With Two Dogs in a Field](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/girl-and-dogs-in-field-ai-generated.jpg)

 Many illustrators avoid AI art like the plague. They feel that using text-to-image tools is the equivalent of tracing another personâ€™s artwork. After all, AI pulls elements from existing images. Since [copyright protection laws donâ€™t apply to AI-generated images](https://www.makeuseof.com/copyright-rules-ai-art/), you canâ€™t claim ownership. Using them in commercial applications has legal consequences.

 With that said, students can still use AI art as inspiration. They should treat art generators like Google or Pinterest. Ask them to generate whatever concept theyâ€™re struggling to visualizeâ€”see how AI approaches it.

 Apart from sparking creativity, art generators can help students play around with different art styles. Indeed, most artists have a specialty. But exploring various techniques gives them deeper insights into other art forms.

## 3\. Chatbots Help Students With Research

 While students should never submit AI-generated content as is, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with reading them. Chatbots streamline research. They provide condensed, straightforward outputs comprising details from widely known and trusted resources.

 Just make sure your students understand AI biases. Chatbots donâ€™t verify informationâ€”they present numbers, data, and claims from their datasets. As a result, erroneous outputs might occasionally arise.

 The best approach is to use chatbots at the start of the research process. Have them simplify topics first. Otherwise, students might have trouble following more complex journals, academic papers, and scholarly databases.

 Consider using Bing instead of ChatGPT for research. Bing Chat lists its sources, making it easier to double-check the information presented.

## 4\. AI Tools Automate Work Tasks

 Educators should stop telling students to avoid offloading tasks. Automation isnâ€™t bad. On the contrary, [automating repetitive, tedious tasks](https://www.makeuseof.com/apps-to-automate-repetitive-tasks/) gives them more time for complex, demanding projects.

 Take essay writing as an example. While students shouldnâ€™t publish AI-generated content, AI can help create article outlines and research topics. The extra time lets them focus on writing and editing.

 Determining what tasks to automate can confuse first-timers, so educators should guide their students. Explain the most common ethical dilemmas in AI. Ensure they understand the limitations and capabilities of AI systems so that they can make informed, moral decisions.

## 5\. Chatbots Give Teachers Third-Party Insights

![A Smiling Female Teacher and a Female Student Talking](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/female-teacher-and-student-in-class.jpg)

 If youâ€™ve ever misunderstood your students, youâ€™re not alone. Many people have trouble reading the thoughts, emotions, and desires of someone younger than them. Cultural generation gaps are hard to overcome.

 Although empathy is innate, you can practice it online by conversing with chatbots. Ask AI to portray different personas. The below image shows how ChatGPT would illustrate a 20-year-old male college student whose personal problems are interfering with school.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 You could also ask ChatGPT for advice.

![ChatGPT Giving Advice About Student Falling Behind in Classes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-giving-advice.jpg)

 Just note that AI isnâ€™t sentient. It only acts out personas based on its trained datasetsâ€”chatting with AI wonâ€™t replace in-person consultations. Try reaching out to your students to gain first-hand insights into their lives.

## 6\. Using AI Still Requires Critical Thinking

 Teach students the constraints of AI. Rather than asking them to avoid these systems, show them how critical thinking overcomes errors and inaccuracies. Emphasize that AIâ€™s just another tool.

 AI systems have varying capabilities. Advanced models produce more human-like text and life-like photos, but older models might perform comparatively worse.

 Take chatbots as an example. Bing Chat uses a GPT-4 model, while ChatGPT runs on a GPT-3.5 model; the former often provides more reliable, accurate information. Explain these limitations. Encourage your students to use their critical thinking skills and objectively analyze which AI systems best suit them.

## 7\. AI-Based Video Enhancement Improves Digital Classrooms

![Hosting a Group Video With Four People on a Tablet](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/group-video-call-on-tablet.jpg)

 Audio-visual aids play a crucial role in modern learning environments. Educators use pre-recorded assets to demonstrate complex topics that might be challenging to explain verbally. Youâ€™ll find them in digital and in-person classes alike.

 Despite the importance of these assets, not many classes get quality presentations. Crafting them requires expensive resources. Educators rarely have the skills, time, and equipment to produce high-definition videos alone.

 To resolve this issue, schools should equip lecturers and professors with [AI-driven video enhancers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/video-quality-enhancers/). They upgrade low-quality media to 720p, 1080p, or 4K. Youâ€™ll find these helpful when editing films taken on smartphones or shot in poor lighting conditions.

## 8\. AI Creates New Job Opportunities

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Despite what skeptics fear, AI wonâ€™t entirely replace human jobs. It's primarily designed to execute rote work. Complex tasks that require critical thinking, creative designs, and subjective interpretations still require human workers.

 If anything, AI creates more job opportunities. Global tech leaders investing billions in the AI race need skilled professionals who can materialize their vision. Theyâ€™ll pay a handsome sum for the building of AI systems.

 Considering the AI industryâ€™s rapid growth, educators should let students explore various tools as early as possible. Show them the [different careers in AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-careers-artificial-intelligence/). Computer programmers could look into system building, while communication experts might excel in prompt engineering.

## Teach and Study the Responsible Use of AI

 AI isnâ€™t inherently dangerous. Ethical issues typically arise when people abuse AI tools and bypass their restrictions. Remember: AI simply responds to prompts. Instead of wholly banning AI, educators should share responsible ways to utilize this technology.

 Likewise, discuss the real-world applications of AI. LLMs, text-to-image generators, and chatbots will continue to impact various industries. Theyâ€™ll eventually become the new norm. Students should start learning how different professions incorporate AI into their daily routines.
