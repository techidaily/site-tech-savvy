Our goal has always been to meet the critical needs of businesses that are struggling with their automation efforts with Digital Intelligence capabilities that accelerate their digital transformation. This past year was especially challenging for many people and organizations, not only personally, but also from a business continuity perspective. We’re proud to have been a part of making an impact where it counts most – being the catalyst for intelligent automation that helps employees do their jobs more efficiently and improves customer experiences.

_Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Marketing at ABBYY_

Increased demand for ABBYY’s Content Intelligence solutions is driven by the company’s strong global market position, proven machine learning technology, continued innovation, and growing worldwide network of partners.

_Sachin Verma, Founder & CEO, at Incture_

The capture market is expected to increase to approximately $1 billion, according to the [IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US45393320 "IDC forecast update") Worldwide Capture Applications Forecast Update, 2020–2024\. IDC also conducted a [survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005206/en/Contribution-of-digital-workers-to-grow-by-50-in-two-years-finds-new-global-research "IDC survey") that found organizations’ average spending for Content Intelligence technologies increased 31% over the last year.

As businesses, employees and customers face disruptions across every sector, especially as more employees work from home, solutions are needed to increase process efficiencies and enhance profit margins. Our content intelligence offerings have become critical for the success of automation initiatives, and we expect this need to continue as companies shift from business continuity to improving the user experience.
