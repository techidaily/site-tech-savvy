## Why ChatGPT Saves Your Conversations

 ChatGPT is a work in progress, as it can sometimes make mistakes or say things that are not true. To improve its performance and quality, OpenAI has expressly stated on [its FAQ page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-what-is-chatgpt) that it needs feedback from ChatGPT users. So, the core reason [ChatGPT saves your conversations is to learn from them](https://www.makeuseof.com/does-chatgpt-learn-from-user-conversations/) and improve itself.

 Also, by saving your chats, ChatGPT helps you remember what conversations youâ€™ve previously had with it. Maybe you forgot something, need some information, or just want a previous chat. ChatGPT lets you talk away without worrying about losing your precious conversations.

 They are safely stored in a cloud server that lets you revisit them whenever and wherever you want. You should understand that ChatGPT does not share your conversations with anyone else, except if you [share them via the shared links feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/).

 The chatbot is not a confidant, so keep your secrets to yourself. It's not safe, especially since OpenAI has been hacked before by cybercriminals who stole the credentials to thousands of ChatGPT accounts.

## How to Stop ChatGPT From Saving Your Conversations

 OpenAI is very clear about how it stores and uses your conversations with ChatGPT. But if you don't want it to save your chats, you can stop it by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) account.
2. Click on your profile in the bottom left corner, and click on **Settings**.

3. Click on data controls and toggle off **Chat history & training**.

 And that's it! You've just made sure that ChatGPT won't keep any record of your chats.

## Don't Worry About ChatGPT Saving Your Conversations

 OpenAI is not interested in using your data for marketing purposes. The company only looks at your conversations with the chatbot to improve its performance and check for any policy violations. You should still be careful not to reveal any personal details to ChatGPT. It might not be very safe.
