## Responsible Study Practices in the Digital Age

 OpenAI’s ChatGPT has made a splash in the world of chatbots. Although it is relatively new (ChatGPT was launched in late 2022), this freakishly capable tool has been embraced by millions of students across the world. While the AI-powered chatbot is undoubtedly groundbreaking, there’s a lot of controversy and ethical dilemmas surrounding the tool.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 ChatGPT’s ability to write logically sound essays in a matter of seconds and analyze problems in a very human manner can tempt students to rely too heavily on it, potentially hindering independent learning skills and critical thinking. If you’re a student, here’s how you shouldn’t be using the AI tool to avoid running into trouble.

## 1\. Don't Rely on ChatGPT for Facts

![ChatGPT shares a factually incorrect answer.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-shares-a-factually-incorrect-answer.jpg)

 While ChatGPT is certainly impressive when it comes to generating convincing responses, it’s important that you [don’t rely on it for factual information](https://www.makeuseof.com/does-chatgpt-lie/). Thanks to its impressive language capabilities, you may assume you can trust the accuracy of ChatGPT’s responses.

 However, the fact is that ChatGPT operates based on the information it has been trained on. This data may include biased or incorrect information, and ChatGPT may generate responses based on that inaccurate information.

 What’s more, the current free-to-use version of ChatGPT does not have access to real-time news and updates. It may draw a blank or provide flawed responses for questions involving recent events and discoveries.

 So, while ChatGPT is a valuable tool when it comes to brainstorming ideas or engaging in thought-provoking discussions, it’s best to verify data in its responses for potential inaccuracies before you cite them anywhere.

## 2\. Don't Use ChatGPT to Proofread Homework

 Can [ChatGPT proofread your assignments](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/)? Technically, yes. The issue with this, however, is that the AI tool lacks contextual understanding, which is vital for accurate proofreading. ChatGPT may, thus, miss subtle mistakes in your assignments, fail to spot inconsistencies, and even provide inaccurate suggestions and corrections.

 Instead of using ChatGPT to proofread your homework, take some time to review your work and self-edit. The best way to proofread your work is by reading your work aloud, at a slow pace. Not only will this help you catch your errors, but it will also keep you from making them over and over again.

 If you’d like extra feedback, don’t hesitate to ask your peers and teachers to have a look at your work.

## 3\. Don't Bypass Learning Obstacles With ChatGPT

 While ChatGPT is certainly helpful to students, it should never be used as a replacement for traditional learning experiences. Challenging assignments allow students to develop critical thinking abilities, problem-solving skills, and an enhanced understanding of the subject. If you rely solely on ChatGPT to overcome roadblocks, you will miss out on valuable learning experiences.

 So, instead, when facing challenges while studying, try to collaborate with your peers, seek clarification from teachers, and break down complex concepts. By actively taking part in the learning progress, you can develop a comprehensive knowledge base.

## 4\. Avoid Using ChatGPT for College Essays

 Your college essay is meant to serve as an opportunity for you to express your motivations and personalize your application by offering a look into who you are as an individual beyond your grades and academic achievements. It isn’t just a collection of facts or a generic write-up about you.

 While ChatGPT may be able to help you with certain word choices or to clean up your writing, it cannot deliver your perspective the way you can, in your voice. For this reason, it’s best to avoid using ChatGPT to write your college essays.

 Instead, spend some time crafting and refining your personal story. There are also several [online tools that can make the essay-writing process easier](http://makeuseof.com/tag/writing-college-admissions-essay/). Finally, make sure to review your essay multiple times and have someone else read your piece and share their feedback as well.

## 5\. Don't Plagiarize ChatGPT-Generated Content

 While content generated by ChatGPT isn’t usually flagged by plagiarism tools, keep in mind that AI-generated text can be detected. In fact, OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, released its own AI classifier that can detect AI-written content. While [these tools may not yet be completely accurate](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-content-detectors-dont-work/), it’s safe to assume that they will become more reliable over time.

 Given this, it’s pretty likely that universities and schools will be able to use these tools to distinguish between AI-written and human-written text. That doesn’t, however, mean you should stop using ChatGPT entirely. Instead of plagiarizing the content generated by the tool, you can use it to ideate, explore different perspectives, or seek feedback on your work.

## 6\. Don’t Use ChatGPT to Make Decisions

 Never use an AI tool to make important academic decisions. Remember that ChatGPT is not a mentor—it lacks personal insight, contextual understanding, and critical thinking skills, which are vital for effective decision-making.

 Instead, seek guidance from subject-matter experts or academic advisors to weigh out the pros and cons of your options. Speaking to reputable sources, engaging in discussions with your peers, and collecting diverse perspectives can help you holistically approach decision-making.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Don’t Ignore Your School’s AI-Usage Guidelines

 Your school or university may have certain dos and don’ts for using AI technology. For instance, your school may permit students to use AI for research purposes and idea generation. However, students may not be allowed to use these tools to complete their assignments or pass assessments.

 The guidelines set by your school are to ensure that students use AI tools, like ChatGPT, ethically within the academic setting. Ignoring these guidelines could lead to consequences such as disciplinary action or academic penalties. So, before you use ChatGPT for academic projects, make sure to familiarize yourself with the guidelines set by your school.

## Use ChatGPT as an Aid, Not a Learning Substitute

 Using ChatGPT as a student has its pros—as long as you use it to formulate your own ideas and are willing to put in the necessary time and research to develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject. If you are considering using ChatGPT during your educational pursuits, make sure to familiarize yourself with the best ways to integrate the tool into your academic life.
