**To download and install uTorrent Web in Windows 10** , follow these steps:

 3) Add the torrent with a downloaded torrent file or with a torrent link. We recommend you to use a torrent file to add torrent, as it takes less time. With a torrent link, you need to download the torrent file first, and this usually takes longer than downloading the torrent file with a browser.

 4) Once you add the torrent file, you can stream the torrent instantly.

## You should use a VPN for torrenting

 When you download torrents, we recommend you to use a VPN to hide your IP address. You may need to download the torrent files from the torrent sites. You may already know that some torrent sites provide pirated content. If you can tell exactly whether the content you’ll download is pirated, you won’t get any troubles. But if you’re not sure how to identify the pirated content, you may get in trouble after downloading the content.

 Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and the government can know what you’ve downloaded with your IP. They can use anti-BT tools to know who downloaded pirated content. If you’ve downloaded the pirated content without knowledge, you can be their subject. You may get warning message from your ISP and tell you that you’ve downloaded the illegal content.

 So to avoid problems like this, we recommend you to use a VPN to hide your IP address. With a VPN, others are not able to track you with a fake IP address.

 Regarding what VPN you can trust, we recommend[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . NordVPN is one of the most popular VPNs around the world. And it’s one of the cheapest VPN services worldwide. For more info about NordVPN, just[go to their official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 You can get **[NordVPN coupons and promo codes](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to get a discount for NordVPN.
