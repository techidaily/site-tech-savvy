## Practical ChatGPT Use-Cases for Job Hunters

 Job hunting can sometimes feel like being stuck in a hamster wheel. You tirelessly scour job boards and spend hours crafting the perfect application, only to get nothing in return. But what if you could break free from the time-consuming, effort-intensive job search cycle and adopt smarter ways to find your dream job?

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 What if ChatGPT could help you transform your job search experience? We've put together six practical ways to use ChatGPT in your job search. Here's how.

## 1\. Make Sense of Job Post Descriptions

 Job postings can sometimes be overwhelming. They are often packed with technical jargon and niche language. This can make it challenging to understand what the job entails, which is what you'll really need to know once you come across a job ad.

 ChatGPT can help you analyze job posts to give you a clear picture of what a job is really about. It will also use this picture of what the job entails to guide you through what to include in your resume and cover letter, as well as the skills to emphasize.

 In an era where recruiters use software to scan and filter through thousands of job applications to find the best candidates, ChatGPT can help you identify the keywords and phrases that recruiters and hiring managers will be looking for. But how can you do this with ChatGPT?

 I'll provide you with a job description in my next prompt. Your goal is to help me make sense of the job description and use it to answer questions I'll be asking.

1. Copy and paste the prompt above or a variation that suits your needs.
2. Copy and paste the job post. Provide as much information as you can find.
3. If after pasting the job post, ChatGPT does not start explaining the job role, use a prompt like "make sense of the job description above" to get the chatbot to describe the job role.
4. After ChatGPT finishes the preliminary explanation, you now start asking questions. You can ask questions like:  
   * What are some keywords or phrases that I should include in my resume or cover letter when applying for this job?  
   * Can you suggest any specific experiences that I should highlight in my application?

 By using ChatGPT to make sense of job descriptions, you can precisely tailor your application materials for each job you apply for and increase your chances of getting hired.

## 2\. Create Resumes and Cover Letters

![Screenshot of ChatGPT generated cover letter for WorldAtlas focusing on soft skills](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot-of-chatgpt-generated-cover-letter-for-worldatlas-focusing-on-soft-skills.jpg)

 Once you're ready for an intense job search, there are a few hurdles you'll need to overcome. One of such hurdles is creating resumes and cover letters—a lot of them. While the bulk of creative inputs in your resumes and cover letters should come from you, ChatGPT can help you improve the quality of your resumes, and produce a lot of copies in a short time.

 You see, when on a job search, there is a good chance that you'll be applying to many companies. With this in mind, you'll need a lot of personalized resumes specially crafted to target each company you are applying to.

 Manually crafting personalized resumes and cover letters for each company can be a tedious task. But if you furnish ChatGPT with important professional information, the AI chatbot can generate multiple personalized documents simultaneously.

 Just asking ChatGPT to whip up a resume isn't going to cut it if you're hoping to create a truly impressive and effective one. But don't panic; we've previously put together a detailed [step-by-step guide on how to create a resume with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-to-write-resume/) as well as a [guide to creating a cover letter with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-cover-letter-using-chatgpt/).

## 3\. Prepare for Interviews

 You've jumped through all the hurdles of identifying a job opportunity, researching the company, crafting a fitting resume, and now you've gotten an invitation. There's just one thing standing in your way—the interview.

 Fortunately, like almost everything in your job search journey, ChatGPT can also help with that. If you're unsure how to prep ChatGPT for a mock interview, here's a good template prompt to help you get started.

 I would like to role-play an interview scenario with you, where you act as the interviewer, and I will be the candidate applying for the PHP software developer position in your company. Your company is ABC Ltd, a language learning and translation startup that offers language translation services and language opportunities. Your role is to ask me interview questions one by one and wait for my answers. Please do not provide explanations or write the entire conversation at once. Treat it like a real interview and ask follow-up questions based on my responses. While asking follow-up questions, do not go down the rabbit hole. The depth of a follow-up should be 2 to 5 questions before asking a new set of questions. To begin, my first prompt is 'Hi.'

 To use the prompt template above, replace the placeholder position and company details with a job role, company name, and description of what the company does. During the interview, you can ask ChatGPT to critique your responses to a question and rate how you're doing so far.

## 4\. Prepare for Salary Negotiation

 Salary negotiations are typically one of the trickiest parts of the interview process. You'd want as much money as possible, but you don't want to appear too ambitious. ChatGPT can help you strike a balance and deal with this dilemma like a pro. But how?

 You can use the AI chatbot to research a reasonable salary for your industry, specific company, and particular role. How's that different from simply googling? Well, Google would provide a lot of generic information, but ChatGPT can take a lot of things into consideration when responding.

 To effectively use ChatGPT for salary research, you'll need to first provide the chatbot with your level of experience, the country, and state where the job is located, whether the job will be remote or onsite, and as much job-related information as possible. After providing this information, you can then prompt the chatbot for help in deciding on a suitable range of salary to settle for.

 In the screenshot below, we asked ChatGPT to list some factors a jobseeker with 15 years of experience in the programming field who is applying for a programming writer role in a start-up at the heart of California should consider.

 Of course, you can ask for the exact salary range or any other details that interest you.

## 5\. Identify Career Opportunities

 The job market is like an iceberg; you only get to see a portion of its actual size. Advertised jobs are only a small fraction of the opportunities that exist. According to a [poll on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shining-light-hidden-job-market-andrew-seaman/), as much as 50% to 70% of job openings fall under the "hidden job market" category, meaning they are never posted publicly. This hidden market is vast and largely untapped, leaving many opportunities waiting to be discovered.

 So, if you rely only on job boards and LinkedIn to find your next opportunity, you could miss out on a world of possibilities. But how do you find unadvertised opportunities? Well, you can start by proactively reaching out to companies, and ChatGPT can help you with that.

 In the screenshot below, we asked ChatGPT to identify some potential job opportunities at Microsoft for a technical writer. It gave some good hints. Of course, your target company doesn't have to be Microsoft.

![Identify career opportunities](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/identify-career-opportunities.jpg)

 We also asked ChatGPT to suggest some roles that could potentially be available in an advertising firm for somehow who has video animation skills. Here are some of the roles ChatGPT suggested we should apply for:

![video animator job suggestions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/video-animator-job-suggestions.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Using ChatGPT to sniff out potential job opportunities isn't too complex. Simply identify a company or an industry, then ask ChatGPT which potential roles would be available in your target company for someone with your skills. Once you've identified an opportunity that interests you, you can then go ahead to send in a pitch, letter of inquiry, or application.

## 6\. Find Alternative Jobs

 If you are not progressing in finding a job in your current niche, it might be time for a switch. Why struggle to find niche jobs that may be in short supply? ChatGPT can help you identify alternative jobs relevant to your skills beyond the jobs you have in mind. Below, we asked ChatGPT to suggest some alternative jobs for a tech content writer, and it brought up some good suggestions.

## Let ChatGPT Take the Wheel

 Job searching can feel like an endless journey of crafting the perfect pitch, writing cover letters, and fine-tuning resumes. It can be a draining and time-consuming process.

 But why not let ChatGPT take the wheel? With its expert knowledge and capabilities, you can sit back and let it do the heavy lifting while you focus on adding the finishing touches to your perfect pitch. Let ChatGPT guide you through the job search maze and help you get through the recruiter's door with ease.
