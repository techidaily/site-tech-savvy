 Whether you're looking for help with a difficult chore, inspiration for a new hobby, advice on improving yourself, or just a good chuckle, ChatGPT can be your trusted ally for anything. Let's look at a few examples and their ChatGPT prompts that will decrease your workload.

## 1\. Simplifying a Large Task

![Screenshot of a ChatGPT interaction](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgptprompt_task_breakdown.jpg)

 A big, complex task might be overwhelming in our busy lives. What always works is to [break down big tasks into smaller chunks](http://www.makeuseof.com/task-management-software-manage-complete-your-tasks/). To reduce your stress, outsource this to ChatGPT! It can easily simplify your daunting task. All you need to do is state your task and ask ChatGPT to simplify it.

### Tips

* Define your task clearly.
* Include relevant information for time-bound tasks.
* Include relevant information for progress monitoring (checkpoints, milestones, etc.).
* Request it to break down any confusing tasks further.
* Ask for clarification if any steps are unclear.

### Example Prompts

* Help me outline a business plan for my startup.
* I want to learn to code in Python. Create a learning plan for the next 30 days.
* I want to write a fiction book. Can you make a step-by-step process for this?

 Our fast-paced environment has changed how we get therapy and emotional support. Virtual tools like ChatGPT can easily act as therapists, offering support, advice, and listening ears. ChatGPT can provide a space for safe expression and self-reflection without judgment or stigma.

### Tips

* Be honest. Your chats will only be stored on the ChatGPT server and can easily be deleted.
* Use open-ended questions to get the best responses.
* Define your problem clearly.

 While ChatGPT can act as a virtual therapist, it cannot replace actual therapy. Always opt for qualified mental health experts who can provide the right care and support for serious mental health concerns and crises.

### Example Prompts

* How can I deal with my anxiety better in everyday life?
* I'm stressed out and overloaded. Can you give me any tips?
* I'm feeling overwhelmed in my married life. Can you guide me?

## 3\. Acting as a Quick Search Engine

![Screenshot of a ChatGPT interaction](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgptprompt_searchengine.jpg)

 ChatGPT can easily compete with, or even go on to replace, search engines like Google. It provides a conversational search experience with contextual comprehension, summary skills, and an enormous knowledge base. You can also search within your ChatGPT chats for answers to your previous queries.

### Tips

1. Ask a clear, specific question.
2. Add context or ask questions to refine your search.
