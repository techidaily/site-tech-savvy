## 9 Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant by Rogan Keel

 Walking into the gym for the first time can be incredibly daunting, especially if you know little or nothing about fitness. Creating a program is also difficult; I still vividly remember spending hours on bodybuilding forums when I first began training in 2014\. Fortunately, getting the information you need is much easier these days—and Rogan Keel’s Gym, Fitness, & Training Assistant is a helpful custom GPT for new gym-goers.

 To use this GPT more effectively, make sure you give it as much information as possible. For example, I gave it my story of what my health condition was like when I first wanted to go to the gym and mentioned dietary requirements. You should also mention how many days you’d like to exercise per week. After giving the assistant all the required information, you’ll get an overview of your diet and exercise regimen.
