 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

## 15\. Mocktail Mixologist

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.
