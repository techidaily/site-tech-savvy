2. Click the edit icon and change the title appropriately.
3. Finally, click the checkmark to save the new title.

## Save Your ChatGPT Conversations to a TXT File

 While you can [share ChatGPT conversations](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/) with others and export your entire chat history, ChatGPT doesn't have a feature that lets you download individual conversations to your local disk.

 You can achieve this by manually copying and pasting your chat into a text file. To copy your conversations manually:

1. Start highlighting the chat texts from the top using your cursor.
2. Proceed by holding down **Shift + PgDn** on your keyboard until you reach the last text in the conversation thread.
3. Once on the last text, press **Ctrl + C** or **Cmd + C** on your keyboard or right-click and select **Copy** to copy the chat to your clipboard.
4. Open the Notepad or any text editor on your computer and paste this conversation into it. Then save the file with a TXT extension.
