## What Do Prompt Engineers Do?

![Man Using PC With Two Screens and a Laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/man-using-desktop-multiple-screens.jpg)

 Prompts refer to the instructions that humans input into AI models. They could either be:

* **User-Generated Inputs:** Users dictate one-time queries and tasks when interacting with AI models.
* **Predefined Instructions:** Developers set predefined rules when training AI models.

 AI has no inherent biases. Its output heavily depends on the prompts you feed it, assuming they fall within its pre-trained datasets.

 Creating prompts doesn't necessarily require coding skills. You can ask chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing AI general knowledge questions outright. The below photo demonstrates a brief exchange.

![Asking ChatGPT a General Question About the Size of China](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-general-question-about-china.jpg)

 Although straightforward, mastering prompt engineering is challenging. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Simple requests use basic queries, but running more complex tasks and routines demands detailed instructions.

 Let’s say you’re [building a food delivery chatbot on Google Dialogflow](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-dialogflow-chatbot-food-delivery-build/). For your platform to work, you must provide clear, precise response patterns to various conversations. Ambiguous rules produce inaccurate, unhelpful dialogues.

 To master prompt engineering with AI models, follow these tips.

### Understand Language Model Architecture

 Study the back-end process of different language models. Understanding how they analyze inputs will help you write accurate, detailed prompts. Maximize their respective processing capacities. Even advanced tools require external instructions to function.

 Likewise, consider the limitations. Sophisticated language models pull up-to-date information from the internet, although they typically follow stricter restrictions. You’ll have to get creative with your prompts.

### Clearly Express Ambiguous Problems

 Prompt engineers must learn to convey ambiguous, challenging problems. Not everyone can interact with AI. In fact, casual users have trouble relaying requests, especially ones that involve multi-step tasks.

 You must provide as much context as possible. AI models only answer inputs. Feeding them vague prompts with unsure phrasing and generic terms will produce subpar results.

### Overcome Data Biases

 AI models are inherently impartial. Any biased output that they produce stems from the datasets their trainers used. Remember: AI only studies patterns and experiences. [Even advanced AI models produce harmful responses](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/), since developers often use large volumes of unfiltered information.

 To minimize inaccuracies, conduct rigorous testing instead of manually sifting through datasets. Continuously feed AI models variations of different prompts to uncover which ones trigger biased answers.

### Test Prompts Endlessly

![Asking ChatGPT to Write Codes for Pokemon Sprites](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-code-writing-prompt.jpg)

 Complex prompts rarely work the first time. You’ll notice the impact of seemingly minute changes as you create more detailed, precise instructions. Don’t let errors discourage you.

 Instead of obsessing over writing flawless prompts in one go, get comfortable with A/B testing. Prompt engineering requires much trial and error. Relentlessly edit formulas until you find the right tone, phrasing, and terms to convey instructions.

### Study Industry Trends

 Prompt engineers should stay up to date with the current industry trends. AI’s fast-paced evolution makes specialization impractical. New technologies can quickly dominate popular ones, so don’t just focus on one AI model.

 Take the competition between different AI platforms as an example. While ChatGPT made waves with GPT-3.5, other companies like Microsoft also developed their own powerful language models, such as Bing AI. Meanwhile, OpenAI continued to innovate and [released GPT-4](http://www.makeuseof.com/best-new-gpt4-features-explained/), a more advanced language model.

## How Much Do Prompt Engineers Make?

 Prompt engineering is still new, yet employers already understand its relevance. [Bloomberg](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-salary-requirements-no-tech-background-2023-3) says the average prompt engineering salary ranges from $175,000 to $335,000 per annum. Considering the ease of entry, you might doubt this estimate. Anyone can talk to AI, after all. Even someone with no tech background can write effective AI prompts.

 However, don’t confuse basic with advanced prompt engineering. Basic prompt engineering involves standard tasks, while advanced prompt engineering involves complex routines and training processes.

 Advanced prompts often contain thousands of carefully chosen words. Making just a few typos or choosing the wrong terms could alter the results altogether. Not many have the skill or know-how for such demanding tasks.

## Why Is Prompt Engineering Important?

 Begin taking prompt engineering courses. Global tech leaders are continuously releasing new AI models—knowing how to utilize these machines will make you hirable. It could even help you [launch a career in tech despite lacking experience](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-launch-career-tech/).

### The Public Needs Pre-Made Prompts

 While prompt engineering has an easy learning curve, casual AI users still find it time-consuming. They prefer using pre-made prompts. Instead of crafting unique formulas, they’ll browse [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) threads and [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories discussing AI prompts.

 Prompt engineers can maximize this demand. Apart from working full-time for AI laboratories, build an online following by sharing effective prompts for popular requests.

### AI Doesn’t Always Do What You Want

 Casual users have the misconception that AI is sentient. They think it has the processing capacity to read between the lines, so they input ambiguous queries.

 Unfortunately, doing so yields inferior results. AI can’t replicate human comprehension. It only formulates responses based on trained datasets, language models, and user experiences.

### Quality Prompts Yield Quality Responses

 Innovative engineers can reinvent pre-existing prompts and find ways to boost precision. There’s always room for improvement. Even simple requests become better with strong verbs and detailed instructions. The below image shows ChatGPT’s response to a brief question.

![ChatGPT Answering a General Question About AI](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-general-question-on-ai.jpg)

 Meanwhile, this photo highlights the impact of using descriptive prompts.

### The Demand for Prompt Engineers Will Increase

![Searching for Prompt Engineer Jobs on Google](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/prompt-engineer-jobs-google.jpg)

 Don’t fret over the limited prompt engineering jobs. Despite the recent advancements, AI is still in the development stage. Global brands have just started releasing AI-powered tools.

 As more companies incorporate language models into their products, expect a spike in demand for prompt engineers. In the meantime, focus on bettering your craft. Build repositories and PDFs of unique, innovative prompts to show potential employers.

## Start Your Career as a Prompt Engineer

 Prompt engineering is an in-demand, rewarding career that requires minimal coding experience. Many non-coders achieve success in the industry. Just note that low barriers to entry create a competitive job market—broaden your options by creating prompts for different LLMs (large language models).

 But if you have an in-depth knowledge of language models and machine learning, explore more technical positions. Don’t stop with just prompt engineering. With your skills, you can already build, train, and develop AI models.
