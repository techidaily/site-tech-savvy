 If you have an Apple silicon Mac, you're in luck because you can install and run the iPad version of Microsoft Copilot on your computer. Here's how:

1. Launch the **App Store** app on your Mac from the Dock, Launchpad, or [the Applications folder in Finder](https://www.makeuseof.com/applications-folder-mac/).
2. Search for "Copilot" to find the app listed under the **iPhone & iPad Apps** section.
3. Click **Get** next to the app's name to install it.
4. You'll find the app in your Launchpad. You can drag it to the Dock to access it quickly.

![Dragging Copilot app from Launchpad to the Dock](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dragging-copilot-app-from-launchpad-to-the-dock.jpg)

 Double-click its icon to start using Copilot right away. Jump to the **Getting Started** section below to get acquainted with the app.

### How to Launch Copilot on Mac With a Keyboard Shortcut

 If adding Copilot to the Dock isn't convenient enough, and you'd like to launch Microsoft's AI chatbot at the press of a button, you can create a custom shortcut using the Shortcuts app in macOS:

1. Launch the built-in **Shortcuts** app on your Mac. You'll see it in the Launchpad inside the **Other** folder. Alternatively, [use Spotlight search on your Mac](http://www.makeuseof.com/spotlight-search-on-mac-beginners-guide/) (**Command + Space**) to find it.
2. Select **All Shortcuts** from the left sidebar and click the **plus (+)** button in the toolbar at the top of the window to create a new shortcut.  
![Adding a new shortcut in macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/adding-a-new-shortcut-in-macos.jpg)
3. Drag the **Open App** action from the right sidebar to the empty space on the left.
4. Click the blue **App** field and use the search bar to find and select **Copilot**.

5. Next, switch to the **Info (i)** tab of the sidebar and click **Add Keyboard Shortcut**.

6. Now, enter a key combination you like, but make sure it doesn't overlap with any other [useful Mac keyboard shortcuts](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/useful-mac-osx-shortcuts-pdf/). Then, hit the **Return** key.

 You can now exit the Shortcuts app and enter the keyboard shortcut you added to quickly launch Microsoft Copilot on your Mac, no matter what you're doing.

## Install Microsoft Copilot as a Web App on Your Mac

 If you have an Intel Mac, you won't be able to install Copilot's iPad app from the Mac App Store. Instead, you'll need to install Microsoft Copilot as a web app on macOS Sonoma or later:

1. First, [update your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-mac-software/) if it's not already running at least macOS Sonoma.
2. Open Safari and head to [Microsoft Copilot's webpage](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).
3. Now, click **File > Add to Dock** from the menu bar.
4. When you get a confirmation pop-up, click **Add**.

## Getting Started With Microsoft Copilot on Your Mac

 When you launch Copilot for the first time, you'll see its welcome screen prompting you to agree to Microsoft's Terms of Service. Click **Continue** and follow these steps to configure Copilot on your Mac properly:

1. The first thing you should do is enable GPT-4, as that's one of the biggest advantages of using Copilot over ChatGPT. Scroll down on the main screen and toggle on **Use GPT-4**.
2. Next, click the **ellipsis (...)** icon in the top-right corner of the window and choose **Show All Tones** to customize Copilot's responses.  
![Enabling GPT-4 in Copilot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enabling-gpt-4-in-copilot.jpg)
3. You can choose from **Creative**, **Balanced**, and **Precise**. By default, it's set to **Creative**, which gets you descriptive responses. I use the **Precise** setting as I prefer concise responses with only the facts that I need.

![Changing tone in the Copilot app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/changing-tone-in-the-copilot-app.jpg)
4. Additionally, you can click **Sign in** in the top-left corner of the window and log in with your Microsoft account. This allows you to ask more questions and have longer conversations with the AI chatbot.

 At this point, you're all set to use Copilot on your Mac at its full potential. If you want to make further tweaks, click the **three-line** icon in the top-left corner to access the app's settings menu. Here, you can change the theme, region and language, permissions, and privacy settings for Copilot.

 You can clear your Copilot search history by heading to the app's privacy settings menu.

## The Benefits of Using Copilot Over ChatGPT

 The biggest advantage of using Microsoft's AI chatbot over OpenAI's ChatGPT offering is that you can [access GPT-4 for free](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-access-gpt-4-free/). This means you can include images in your queries, take advantage of DALL·E 3 art generation, install third-party plugins to expand Copilot's feature set, and more.

 ChatGPT users, on the other hand, have to [pay a monthly fee for a ChatGPT Plus subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/) to access these features. Even though it's possible to [use ChatGPT on a Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-mac/), you won't find the iPhone or iPad version of ChatGPT on the Mac App Store.

 It's also worth noting that ChatGPT doesn't let you change the tone of its responses like Copilot. All in all, if you want the best AI chatbot experience on your Mac without having to spend a penny, Microsoft Copilot is your best bet—at least for now.
