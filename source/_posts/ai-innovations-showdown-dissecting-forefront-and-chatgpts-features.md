 ChatGPT has become something of a household name since its launch in late 2022, but the AI industry itself is also gaining traction. ChatGPT is far from the only AI chatbot in existence, with some platforms even offering a handful of AI chatbots and LLMs to choose from.

 Take Forefront AI, for example. This platform hosts a number of LLMs and even has its own version to try out. So, how exactly does Forefront AI work, and is it better than ChatGPT?

## What Is Forefront AI?

[Forefront AI](http://www.forefront.ai) is an online platform that offers businesses and individuals access to five different [LLMs (large language models)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/): GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude Instant 1.2, Claude 2, and Forefront. While GPT-3.5, Forefront's chat, and Claude Instant are entirely free to use, you'll need to upgrade to the premium version of Forefront to access [GPT-4 and Claude 2](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-pro-how-compare-chatgpt-plus/) (which we'll discuss in more detail a little later).

![screenshot of forefront AI chat starting screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/forefront-chat-1.jpg)

 You can either use these LLMs as they are on Forefront via its chatbot service or modify a pre-existing AI model to better fit your lifestyle or company needs. Forefront is also designed to help you integrate LLMs with other software programs, including operating systems, cloud services, and coding environments. It can serve as a one-stop shop for those who want to combine natural language processors with the software they desire.

 For instance, you may want to integrate a modified version of GPT-3.5 with an app you're developing. Maybe it's a [AI-powered grammar-checking](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/) extension or a financial news app. If there's a reason why you think GPT-3.5 would be useful, you can use Forefront AI to modify the software to fit your app's needs.

 Forefront also offers Personas for users to interact with.

 Forefront's Personas are specifically trained versions of the available LLMs. For instance, you can access a financial analyst, legal translator, product manager, or even a software engineer Persona using this feature.

![forefront ai personas selection screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/forefront-ai-1.jpg)

 If you want to learn about the world or just have a little fun, you can also talk to historical figures through Forefront. The platform has LLM versions trained to respond like certain well-known individuals and fictional characters, such as Joan of Arc, John Lennon, Socrates, R2D2, Voldemort, and Superman.

### Forefront's Plan Tiers

 You can use Forefront AI entirely for free, but there are certain features that are only accessible to paying customers. There are a number of tiers that you can access, with varying monthly fees.

| **Forefront AI Free Plan**  | Free      | Access to GPT-3.5, Claude Instant 1.2, and Forefront (100 messages per three hours). |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forefront AI Pro Plan**   | $29/month | Access to all LLMs, including 30 messages for GPT-4 and Claude 2 per three hours.    |
| **Forefront AI Ultra Plan** | $69/month | Access to all LLMs, including 70 messages for GPT-4 and Claude 2 per three hours.    |

 As previously mentioned, you can use GPT-3.5, Claude Instant 1.2, and Forefront's own LLM at no charge. You can send 100 messages every three hours with the free plan, with a token input limit of 4,096, as well as five internet searches and three file uploads every three hours.

 To send infinite messages using these three LLMs, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro plan, which costs $29 monthly. The Pro plan also lets you send 30 GPT-4 messages and 30 Claude 2 messages every three hours. What's more, you've got infinite file uploads, infinite image searches, and a 100,000 token input limit.

 If you want to access all Forefront AI can offer, you'll need to sign up for the Ultra plan, which will cost you $69 monthly. With this plan, you can send 70 GPT-4 and 70 Claude 2 messages every three hours and use the three other LLMs as much as you want. Along with a 250,000 token input limit, you'll also enjoy infinite file uploads and internet searches.

## The Downsides of Forefront AI

 Forefront AI is a versatile platform with a decent array of options, but it has drawbacks.

 Firstly, the chat interface can sometimes be slow to respond to prompts, especially if you activate the internet search feature. After all, the LLM needs to collect browser search data and appropriately word it before responding, which can take longer than a response that wouldn't require a browser search.

 It's also worth noting that the Personas offered by Forefront aren't always bang-on accurate. This is often due to old data that the LLM you're using was trained on. For instance, if you're using GPT-3.5 with a Persona, all news and updates associated with the figure or character occurring post-September 2021 won't be included, as GPT-3.5 is only trained with data up to September 2021\.

 When using the Forefront AI LLM, you may also be fed responses that seem a little jarring. When using an LLM, you want natural, human-like responses, so abrupt or robotic responses can be off-putting. We'll discuss Forefront's own LLM a little more soon.

## Is Forefront AI Better Than ChatGPT?

 Forefront AI is a little more versatile than ChatGPT. While the latter only offers two LLMs from OpenAI, the former offers five LLMs from three separate developers, giving the user the pick of the bunch.

 However, to use GPT-4 to its full extent via Forefront AI, you'll need to pay $69 monthly, whereas ChatGPT Plus lets you use GPT-4 as much as you want for just $20 monthly. If GPT-4 is the only LLM you're really interested in using, you're better off with ChatGPT Plus.

 Another factor to note is compatibility. You can use ChatGPT via OpenAI's app on your iOS- or Android-based smartphone, making it easy to access GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 on the go. Forefront AI, on the other hand, does not offer a smartphone app, so you can only use it via your desktop or smartphone browser.

**Download:** ChatGPT for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2030293/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&hl=en&gl=US) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) (Free, premium version available)

 When using GPT-3.5 via Forefront and then using it via OpenAI, we noticed some key differences. For instance, GPT-3.5 generally gave more in-depth answers when used on its native website, whereas the answers were a little less detailed on Forefront AI.

![chatgpt explaining the concept of comedy](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/chatgpt-explaining-the-concept-of-comedy.jpg)

 For instance, we asked GPT-3.5 to explain the concept of comedy on the Forefront AI and OpenAI websites. While Forefront gave a 200-word response, OpenAI provided a 500-word response, along with bullet points highlighting the various elements that makeup comedy as a whole.

![gpt on forefront ai explaining the concept of comedy](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gpt-on-forefront-ai-explaining-the-concept-of-comedy.jpg)

 We also asked GPT-3.5 to explain the American Congress on the two different platforms. ChatGPT's GPT-3.5 provided a 600-word response, breaking down the different factors of Congress in bullet points for a more digestible read. On Forefront AI, GPT-3.5 provided a 300-word response, leaving out some key pointers that were included when asked on the OpenAI website.

 Evidently, using GPT-3.5 via OpenAI allowed for more detailed answers.

### Forefront and ChatGPT's LLMs Training and Data Cut-Off

![A phone against a green background with ChatGPT open on the screen.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/phone-with-chatgpt-open-on-screen.jpg)

 Though Forefront AI gives you access to five different LLMs, only one of these is developed by Forefront AI. Forefront's LLM chat is currently in its alpha phase, meaning it's still being worked on and tested. You can use it for free, but it's important to note that it hasn't been perfected, so you may come across some kinks and frustrations.

 GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, on the other hand, have already been rigorously tested, so you'll likely run into fewer issues. However, Forefront's training data leads up to 2023, whereas GPT-3.5's data ends in September 2021, and GPT-4's data ends in January 2022\. So, if it's the latest data you're looking for, Forefront may serve you better.

 GPT-4 will also be getting an interesting upgrade in Autumn 2023, which allows users to search the internet via OpenAI's latest LLM.

 OpenAI announced its internet search feature in September 2023, with the initial rollout taking place for ChatGPT Plus users on the 27th. This allows GPT-4 to access data past September 2021, making it even more useful and giving it the edge over some other LLMs.

 However, this feature still has some limitations. When we tried GPT-4's internet search, the LLM told us that it couldn't access certain web pages, particularly those with "robot.txt" files, which are responsible for initiating the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Many websites are [choosing to block OpenAI's GPT Bot](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gptbot-and-why-are-websites-blocking-it/) to protect their content, especially as [blocking GPT Bot is an easy process](https://www.makeuseof.com/block-ai-chatbot-scraping-website/).

![screenshot of gpt4 conversation](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gpt4-internet-search.jpg)

 This makes it impossible for GPT-4 to take information from web pages with stricter robot.txt parameters in place.

## Forefront Lets You Bounce Between LLMs

 Though Forefront AI's LLM is still being worked on, there's no denying that this platform offers a versatile LLM experience for both paying and non-paying users. However, if it's purely ChatGPT you're after, you may be better off using the tool on its native website to cut out the middleman.

 You can either use these LLMs as they are on Forefront via its chatbot service or modify a pre-existing AI model to better fit your lifestyle or company needs. Forefront is also designed to help you integrate LLMs with other software programs, including operating systems, cloud services, and coding environments. It can serve as a one-stop shop for those who want to combine natural language processors with the software they desire.

 For instance, you may want to integrate a modified version of GPT-3.5 with an app you're developing. Maybe it's a [AI-powered grammar-checking](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/) extension or a financial news app. If there's a reason why you think GPT-3.5 would be useful, you can use Forefront AI to modify the software to fit your app's needs.

 Forefront also offers Personas for users to interact with.

 Forefront's Personas are specifically trained versions of the available LLMs. For instance, you can access a financial analyst, legal translator, product manager, or even a software engineer Persona using this feature.

 If you want to learn about the world or just have a little fun, you can also talk to historical figures through Forefront. The platform has LLM versions trained to respond like certain well-known individuals and fictional characters, such as Joan of Arc, John Lennon, Socrates, R2D2, Voldemort, and Superman.

### Forefront's Plan Tiers

 You can use Forefront AI entirely for free, but there are certain features that are only accessible to paying customers. There are a number of tiers that you can access, with varying monthly fees.

| **Forefront AI Free Plan**  | Free      | Access to GPT-3.5, Claude Instant 1.2, and Forefront (100 messages per three hours). |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forefront AI Pro Plan**   | $29/month | Access to all LLMs, including 30 messages for GPT-4 and Claude 2 per three hours.    |
| **Forefront AI Ultra Plan** | $69/month | Access to all LLMs, including 70 messages for GPT-4 and Claude 2 per three hours.    |

 As previously mentioned, you can use GPT-3.5, Claude Instant 1.2, and Forefront's own LLM at no charge. You can send 100 messages every three hours with the free plan, with a token input limit of 4,096, as well as five internet searches and three file uploads every three hours.

 To send infinite messages using these three LLMs, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro plan, which costs $29 monthly. The Pro plan also lets you send 30 GPT-4 messages and 30 Claude 2 messages every three hours. What's more, you've got infinite file uploads, infinite image searches, and a 100,000 token input limit.

 If you want to access all Forefront AI can offer, you'll need to sign up for the Ultra plan, which will cost you $69 monthly. With this plan, you can send 70 GPT-4 and 70 Claude 2 messages every three hours and use the three other LLMs as much as you want. Along with a 250,000 token input limit, you'll also enjoy infinite file uploads and internet searches.

## The Downsides of Forefront AI

 Forefront AI is a versatile platform with a decent array of options, but it has drawbacks.

 Firstly, the chat interface can sometimes be slow to respond to prompts, especially if you activate the internet search feature. After all, the LLM needs to collect browser search data and appropriately word it before responding, which can take longer than a response that wouldn't require a browser search.

 It's also worth noting that the Personas offered by Forefront aren't always bang-on accurate. This is often due to old data that the LLM you're using was trained on. For instance, if you're using GPT-3.5 with a Persona, all news and updates associated with the figure or character occurring post-September 2021 won't be included, as GPT-3.5 is only trained with data up to September 2021\.

 When using the Forefront AI LLM, you may also be fed responses that seem a little jarring. When using an LLM, you want natural, human-like responses, so abrupt or robotic responses can be off-putting. We'll discuss Forefront's own LLM a little more soon.

## Is Forefront AI Better Than ChatGPT?

 Forefront AI is a little more versatile than ChatGPT. While the latter only offers two LLMs from OpenAI, the former offers five LLMs from three separate developers, giving the user the pick of the bunch.

 However, to use GPT-4 to its full extent via Forefront AI, you'll need to pay $69 monthly, whereas ChatGPT Plus lets you use GPT-4 as much as you want for just $20 monthly. If GPT-4 is the only LLM you're really interested in using, you're better off with ChatGPT Plus.

 Another factor to note is compatibility. You can use ChatGPT via OpenAI's app on your iOS- or Android-based smartphone, making it easy to access GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 on the go. Forefront AI, on the other hand, does not offer a smartphone app, so you can only use it via your desktop or smartphone browser.

**Download:** ChatGPT for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2030293/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&hl=en&gl=US) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) (Free, premium version available)

 When using GPT-3.5 via Forefront and then using it via OpenAI, we noticed some key differences. For instance, GPT-3.5 generally gave more in-depth answers when used on its native website, whereas the answers were a little less detailed on Forefront AI.

![chatgpt explaining the concept of comedy](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/chatgpt-explaining-the-concept-of-comedy.jpg)

 For instance, we asked GPT-3.5 to explain the concept of comedy on the Forefront AI and OpenAI websites. While Forefront gave a 200-word response, OpenAI provided a 500-word response, along with bullet points highlighting the various elements that makeup comedy as a whole.

![gpt on forefront ai explaining the concept of comedy](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gpt-on-forefront-ai-explaining-the-concept-of-comedy.jpg)

 We also asked GPT-3.5 to explain the American Congress on the two different platforms. ChatGPT's GPT-3.5 provided a 600-word response, breaking down the different factors of Congress in bullet points for a more digestible read. On Forefront AI, GPT-3.5 provided a 300-word response, leaving out some key pointers that were included when asked on the OpenAI website.

 Evidently, using GPT-3.5 via OpenAI allowed for more detailed answers.

 Though Forefront AI gives you access to five different LLMs, only one of these is developed by Forefront AI. Forefront's LLM chat is currently in its alpha phase, meaning it's still being worked on and tested. You can use it for free, but it's important to note that it hasn't been perfected, so you may come across some kinks and frustrations.

 GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, on the other hand, have already been rigorously tested, so you'll likely run into fewer issues. However, Forefront's training data leads up to 2023, whereas GPT-3.5's data ends in September 2021, and GPT-4's data ends in January 2022\. So, if it's the latest data you're looking for, Forefront may serve you better.

 GPT-4 will also be getting an interesting upgrade in Autumn 2023, which allows users to search the internet via OpenAI's latest LLM.

 OpenAI announced its internet search feature in September 2023, with the initial rollout taking place for ChatGPT Plus users on the 27th. This allows GPT-4 to access data past September 2021, making it even more useful and giving it the edge over some other LLMs.

 However, this feature still has some limitations. When we tried GPT-4's internet search, the LLM told us that it couldn't access certain web pages, particularly those with "robot.txt" files, which are responsible for initiating the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Many websites are [choosing to block OpenAI's GPT Bot](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gptbot-and-why-are-websites-blocking-it/) to protect their content, especially as [blocking GPT Bot is an easy process](https://www.makeuseof.com/block-ai-chatbot-scraping-website/).

## Forefront Lets You Bounce Between LLMs

 Though Forefront AI's LLM is still being worked on, there's no denying that this platform offers a versatile LLM experience for both paying and non-paying users. However, if it's purely ChatGPT you're after, you may be better off using the tool on its native website to cut out the middleman.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 ChatGPT has become something of a household name since its launch in late 2022, but the AI industry itself is also gaining traction. ChatGPT is far from the only AI chatbot in existence, with some platforms even offering a handful of AI chatbots and LLMs to choose from.

 Take Forefront AI, for example. This platform hosts a number of LLMs and even has its own version to try out. So, how exactly does Forefront AI work, and is it better than ChatGPT?

## What Is Forefront AI?

[Forefront AI](http://www.forefront.ai) is an online platform that offers businesses and individuals access to five different [LLMs (large language models)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/): GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude Instant 1.2, Claude 2, and Forefront. While GPT-3.5, Forefront's chat, and Claude Instant are entirely free to use, you'll need to upgrade to the premium version of Forefront to access [GPT-4 and Claude 2](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-claude-pro-how-compare-chatgpt-plus/) (which we'll discuss in more detail a little later).
