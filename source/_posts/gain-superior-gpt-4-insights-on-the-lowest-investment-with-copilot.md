 If this is the first you've heard of GPT-4 Turbo, it's one of the more advanced AI models at the time of writing. It's designed by OpenAI, the people who invented the [wildly popular ChatGPT service](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/).

 To put GPT-4 Turbo into perspective; when ChatGPT went viral, it was using the 3.5 model. After that, OpenAI released the GPT-4 model, which could handle queries better and sounded more human. Finally, they made the model process faster and thus arrived at GPT-4 Turbo.

 Right now, the best way to use GPT-4 Turbo for free is via Microsoft Copilot. It may seem weird that you have to go through Microsoft instead of OpenAI, but the two companies have a really close relationship. As such, it's not unusual to see OpenAI's features appear within Microsoft's AI assistants.

## How to Use GPT-4 Turbo for Free With Microsoft Copilot

 To get started with GPT-4 Turbo, just boot up Copilot and start talking with it. At the time of writing, Copilot will use GPT-4 Turbo by default when talking to a user on the free tier. Paid users can go back to previous models if they wish, but you don't need to worry about that if you just want to use the latest and greatest model.

### How to Use GPT-4 Turbo for Free on Windows 10 and 11

 If you're a Windows 10 or 11 user, there's a very good chance you have a Copilot button on your taskbar. To get started with GPT-4 Turbo, just click this button and begin chatting with the chatbot when it appears.

 If you want to bring Copilot up faster, you can do so by pressing **Win + C**. Or, if you're lucky enough to own a [laptop with a dedicated Copilot button](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsofts-copilot-key-windows-11-pc/), just press that to bring up the assistant at any time.

 If you don't have a Copilot button yet or use a different operating system, you can still use the [Copilot website](https://copilot.microsoft.com/). Open it up, start talking, and it will automatically use GPT-4 Turbo to parse your prompts.

 If you're on mobile, you can download the [Copilot app for Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2032122/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.copilot&hl=en&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-copilot/id6472538445). The app has a toggle when you open it that enables or disables GPT-4\. It may not be the Turbo version, but it should still be powerful enough to handle your queries.
