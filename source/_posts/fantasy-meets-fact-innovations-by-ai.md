## Fantasy Meets Fact: Innovations by AI

 Recent advancements in language, text-to-image, and text-to-video models enable AI to produce hyper-realistic output. Many even confuse them with organic, human content.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Although this feat signifies a technological milestone, it also blurs the line between reality and fantasy. AI images, text, and videos manufacture digital content that overshadows authentic experiences. Here are the ways AI creates an illusion of reality.

## 1\. Some Treat AI-Generated Personas as Real People

![AI-Generated Virtual Girlfriend With Asian Features](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-girl-virtual-gf.jpg)

 AI virtual girlfriend/boyfriend apps are becoming more realistic than ever. They simulate romantic relationships through AI-generated personas, which users can customize to their preferences. Some prefer human-like characters with intricate features, while others replicate fictional characters.

 Most people use dating simulators to cope with loneliness. Apps running on modern [natural language processing](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/) (NLP) and [large language models](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/) (LLM) mimic real human conversations. So users feel they “connect” with these AI partners.

 Ironically, AI girlfriend and boyfriend apps worsen social isolation by perpetuating toxic beliefs about interpersonal relationships. Users want partners who’ll live up to their made-up AI personas. Some would even go as far as to marry their AI-generated companions and give up on human relationships altogether.

## 2\. Chatbots Provide Fake Emotional Support

 It’s common to use generative AI chatbots for psychotherapy. AI platforms scrape mental health advice from their datasets and mimic human-like speech through LLMs. Their output is neutral and generic, yet many will explore AI tools rather than paying for psychotherapy sessions.

 Apart from AI’s accessibility, some people also prefer confiding in judgment-free, unbiased algorithms. They feel uncomfortable confiding in another person about their problems. Just because you’re talking to a licensed professional doesn’t mean communication barriers won’t arise.

 That said, [treating AI chatbots like therapists is dangerous](https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-using-ai-free-therapist-psychiatrist/). AI can’t empathize with you or understand your situation—it uses NLP to comprehend input and presents the corresponding output based on its datasets. Please see a licensed therapist or psychiatrist if you need mental health advice.

## 3\. Users Imitate Voices Through Speech Synthesis

 Advancements in text-to-speech and speech-to-speech models led to the rise of affordable, accessible AI voice generators. They produce natural-sounding speech output. Depending on input quality and model sophistication, anyone can clone another person’s voice accurately.

 Developers often use AI voice generators to synthesize video voice-overs, add speech functions to virtual characters, or program voice-activated apps. They’re cheaper than recording from scratch. Likewise, some people use voice generators to poke fun at personalities and imitate them. You’ve likely seen fake song covers making rounds online.

 But don’t underestimate the [security risks of AI voice generators](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-voice-generators-security-threat/)—crooks are exploiting these tools to spread misinformation and execute social engineering attacks. Even tech-savvy individuals could fall for AI-synthesized voices if they’re careless.

## 4\. Image and Video Generation Tools Create Entirely New Identities

 The proliferation of AI-driven voice, image, and text generators enables users to create an entirely new persona online. Take [virtual influencers](https://www.makeuseof.com/popular-virtual-influencers/), for instance. Many AI-generated avatars have super-realistic, lifelike features—they could pass off as humans.

 While creating realistic avatars brings society much closer to the metaverse, it also helps scammers perform more sophisticated attacks. They create fake personas for identity theft and [online dating scams](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/spot-avoid-online-dating-scammer/). And when crooks combine these advanced technologies with psychological manipulation, they deceive a broader range of victims.

 What’s worse is that some victims fall into the delusion that they can form genuine connections with AI personas. The desire for companionship gets the best of them. They choose to overlook the fact that the strangers operating these personas couldn’t care less about them.

## 5\. AI Content Floods SERPs

 AI chatbots significantly impacted the content industry. Individual writers, marketing agencies, content mills, and even legit publications are exploring ways to hasten the writing process with AI. After all, advanced LLMs can produce a 500-word piece in under 15 seconds.

 There are [several ethical ways for writers to use AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-use-ai-as-writer-editor/)—the problem is that most creators want to churn out content fast. Obsessing over speed hurts quality. AI scrapes information from its training datasets; it doesn’t check facts or compare resources. The resulting output is often unoriginal and misleading.

 To make matters worse, many low-effort AI articles still rank high through advanced SEO techniques. Most don’t even notice which Google results are AI-generated. They could be reading and citing misleading, factually incorrect information without realizing it.

## 6\. Deepfakes Destroy Reputations

 AI-driven generative models can imitate other people’s features, voices, and mannerisms through digitally manipulated media. Take the below TikTok video featuring “Tom Cruise.” Millions would believe it’s the real deal if the account didn’t explicitly state it’s a deepfake video.

 But not everyone’s as honest as them. Crooks exploit deepfake videos to spread misleading, damaging, and sexually suggestive content. They can manufacture almost any clip with the necessary editing skills and tools.

## 7\. Immersive VR/AR Experience Distorts Your Senses

![Person Scrolling Nonstop on Phone While in Bed](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/man-in-bed-scrolling-phone.jpg)

 AI models enable [virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/augmented-vs-virtual-reality-whats-difference/) technologies to provide a more immersive experience. Their hyper-realistic output thoroughly stimulates the senses. And as high-end VR/AR devices develop, their standard auditory, visual, and haptic cues will also improve.

 Although fascinating, immersing too often in extended reality distorts your natural senses. VR/AR platforms detach you from your tangible surroundings. Too much exposure to artificial sensory triggers will make it harder to separate reality from simulations.

 Some users even develop an overdependence on extended realities. They’ll transport to simulations customized to their wants, demands, and preferences rather than face the real world.

[Using VR/AR devices for extended periods has several risks](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-virtual-reality-bad-for-you/), including eye strain, social isolation, and susceptibility to cyberattacks.

## 8\. AI Business Systems Create Unrealistic Profit Expectations

 AI is transforming the way companies across different sectors operate. [Fox](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/small-businesses-using-ai-loving-it) reports that 90 percent of small businesses have already integrated AI chatbots into their workflow. Likewise, technologically adept professionals are exploring more advanced models.

 Yes, [businesses can boost productivity through AI automation](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-you-can-use-ai-technology-improve-your-business/), but solely relying on these systems presents the risk of overcapitalization. Full-scale AI systems are expensive. Diving into AI ill-prepared will only spike your overhead, making it even harder to get a return on your investment.

 AI isn’t the golden ticket to success. Misinformed entrepreneurs should ditch the false belief that replacing human workers with AI spikes profits. Adopting new systems could still lead to losses if you forego proper planning.

## Drawing the Line Between Fantasy and Reality

 Differentiating between the virtual and real world will become even harder as AI technologies advance. Sophisticated models will generate more realistic output. The only way to combat these widespread false realities is to explore AI yourself—study its functions and limitations.

 Also, always view AI with skepticism. It has come a long way from spitting incoherent phrases, but it still can’t replace proper research and better judgments. Blindly trusting AI platforms merely leaves you prone to misinformation.
