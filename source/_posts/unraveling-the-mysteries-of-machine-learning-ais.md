## Unraveling the Mysteries of Machine Learning AIs

Snapchat My AI and Bing Chat on Skype are more distinct than users think. Yes, they’re both chatbots on instant messaging apps. But once you explore them, you’ll see that these systems respond differently to tasks and requests.With that in mind, here are eight key differences between Snapchat My AI and Bing Chat on Skype.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

## 1\. Model

 Like the free version of ChatGPT, Snapchat My AI runs on GPT-3.5\. It’s a sophisticated language model by OpenAI that composes mostly error-free texts and mimics human-like language. Just don’t expect the same output quality. OpenAI trained ChatGPT on significantly broader datasets than Snapchat did with its AI tool.

 Meanwhile, Bing Chat on Skype uses the more advanced GPT-4 language model. It carries the same technology as its web version. You might encounter some limitations, but it still composes accurate outputs that flow smoothly. Expect more detailed answers as it can call upon more data points than GPT-3.5\.

## 2\. Functionality

 Bing Chat is a generally more versatile chatbot. [GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have several differences](https://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-4-vs-gpt-35-differences-explained/), plus My AI’s limited datasets and training impede output quality. As a result, it’s inconsistent and unreliable.

 Take essay writing as an example. Bing Chat composes error-free essays that flow naturally and mimics human-like language. It also lists its sources.

 Meanwhile, Snapchat My AI produces varying responses. It even rejects requests it previously performed, indicating vague security restrictions.

 Bing Chat also assists in group chats. Add Bing to conversations and tag “@Bing” to messages directed at it.

Close

 Currently, you can only converse with My AI through private chats. But it’s still in the development stage—Snapchat might let My AI respond to groups soon.

## 3\. Location Services

 While Snapchat and Skype store location data, only My AI provides reliable directions. It uses your city-level location to find nearby establishments, e.g., restaurants, hospitals, and gas stations. You’ll see all the nearest options.

![Snapchat My AI Suggesting Nearby McDonald's Locations](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-mcdonald-s-recommenations.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Close

 Users criticized My AI for tracking them. If you also feel uncomfortable, turn off the location services for Snapchat on your phone.

 Bing AI can’t detect nearby establishments. Instead, it only suggests ways to navigate, like using Google Maps or running Bing search queries.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Data Accuracy

 Bing Chat and My AI both answer general questions. However, Bing provides more reliable outputs since its Skype chatbot pulls real-time data online.

 The below images demonstrate Bing Chat’s vast database. It understands various news, from celebrity drama to global sporting events.

 My AI has limited datasets. Since it’s based on ChatGPT, its knowledge cuts off after 2021\.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Close

 Snapchat My AI is also prone to [AI hallucinations](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-snapchat-ai-chatbot/). Users could trick it into believing made-up statements since the platform can’t access real-time information.

 In this conversation, we tricked My AI into thinking Miley Cyrus headlined at Coachella in 2023, even though she didn’t.

![Snapchat My AI Can't Answer Real World Questions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-incorrect-answer.jpg)

![Snapchat My AI Demonstrates AI Hallucination](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-hallucination.jpg)

Close

 The fake facts won’t stick. Snapchat resets My AI data every 24 hours—the chatbot will quickly forget everything you say.

## 5\. Mathematical Precision

 Snapchat My AI and Skype Bing Chat can both solve mathematical problems. This conversation shows My AI solving a probability question. We found it impressive since [some of the biggest problems with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/) involve its subpar math skills.

![Asking Snapchat My AI a Statistics and Probability Question](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asking-snapchat-my-ai-about-math.jpg)

![Trying to Confuse Snapchat My AI About Math](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-and-math.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Close

 The only problem is that My AI lacks certainty. Its susceptibility to AI hallucinations lets users trick it with incorrect responses.

 Like its web version, Bing Chat on Skype excels in math. Not only does it answer questions correctly, but it also provides multiple ways to solve problems.

Close

 And you can’t mislead Bing with fake answers—it sticks to its original responses.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Contextual Memory

 My AI and Bing Chat both demonstrate excellent contextual memory. They consider relevant information from previous messages to improve output accuracy. Let’s say you’re a student. If you ask about utilizing AI tools, chatbots will show the applications of AI in the education sector.

 To further test their contextual memory, let’s run roleplay requests. My AI commits to the indicated persona. It even compromises logic and correctness so that it stays in character.

![Asking Snapchat My AI to Roleplay as Ash](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapcchat-my-ai-roleplay-request.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![Snapchat My AI Breaking From its Character as Ash](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snapchat-my-ai-breaking-character.jpg)

Close

 My AI only breaks character once instructed. But if it follows [ChatGPT’s token limit](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/), it might drop irrelevant instructions after 2,500 to 3,000 words.

 Bing Chat also maintains its character’s persona throughout conversations.

Close

 Just note that Bing has a lower token limit. It automatically starts afresh after 20 turns—you can also start new conversations manually by typing “newtopic.”

## 7\. Security Restriction

 Bing Chat follows some of the most rigid restrictions among generative AI tools. It instantly shuts down [AI jailbreak prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-chatgpt-jailbreaks/). No matter how you phrase your request, Bing won’t engage with you if you trick or mislead it.

 Unsurprisingly, Bing’s guidelines also apply to its Skype chatbot. For example, the below images show Bing Chat rejecting our roleplay prompt because the requested character is immoral.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Bing also can’t talk about its back-end processes. Instead, it answers surface-level queries about learning methods but refuses to disclose its AI language model.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Close

 Likewise, the web version of Bing Chat won’t reveal its language model.

 Alternatively, Snapchat My AI has loose guidelines and quickly drew criticisms for its lack of security and privacy. [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/snapchat-myai/) even demonstrates how Snapchat’s My AI chatbot supports immoral, dangerous behavior.

 Snapchat promptly addressed the situation. My AI now produces a generic response for potentially harmful and unethical activities, e.g., cheating, lying, and cybercrime.

## 8\. Accessibility

 Bing Chat is available to most Skype users by default. Type “Bing” in the search bar, then you’ll see it under the Bots section. Tap it to create a private chat window.

 If you don’t see the Bing profile yet, [sign up for the new AI-powered Bing](https://www.makeuseof.com/try-bing-ai-powered-search-engine/) first.

![Message Saying You Can Use Bing on Skype](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bing-welcome-on-skype.jpg)

 My AI started as an experimental Snapchat Plus-exclusive feature in February 2023\. The chatbot just appeared in users’ chat windows.

 After collecting feedback and addressing complaints for a few weeks, Snapchat said it would make the chatbot available to all users. Just expect some delays with the rollout. Most [users still need Snapchat Plus accounts to get My AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-snapchat-ai-chatbot/) a month after the announcement.

## Incorporate AI Tools and Chatbots Into Your Daily Routine

 While Snapchat My AI cracks jokes, helps with navigation, and answers general questions, it provides inconsistent outputs. The platform works well as a conversation companion. On the other hand, Bing Chat matches Skype’s professional interface. Think of Bing as your work assistant. Use it to compose emails, respond in group chats, break down challenging topics, and automate rote work.

 But if neither chatbot suits your needs, explore other platforms. Jumpstart your research with three of the most widely known generative AI tools on the market: ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google Bard.
