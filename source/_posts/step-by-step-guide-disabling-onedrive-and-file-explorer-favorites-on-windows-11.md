Quick access view in File Explorer is one of new features in Windows 10\. It allows you to access some frequently used folders or recently used files quickly. But in the same time, it can be annoying.   
  
There will be no room for privacy especially if you share the computer with others.  
  
In Windows 10, File Explorer opens to Quick access by default. In this case, if you want to access disk drive via File Explorer, you need to click “This PC” link manually then you can open the drive.  
  
If you wish to disable Quick access in Windows 10, just follow simple steps below.  
  
1\. Open**File Explorer**.  
  
2\. Right-click on**Quick access** in left navigation pane and select**Options**.
