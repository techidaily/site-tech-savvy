 But what if ChatGPT isn't currently working? Is ChatGPT down for everyone else, or are you the only one that can't use it?

 We'll take a look at four ways you can find out ChatGPT's current status, so you know if ChatGPT is down.

## 1\. Check OpenAI

 Even if [ChatGPT is the fastest-growing app](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-became-fastest-growing-app/) of all time, sometimes it stops working. The best way to check if ChatGPT is down is to use [OpenAI](https://status.openai.com/) for real-time server analysis, so you can easily figure out if ChatGPT is down for everyone else.

## 2\. Check if ChatGPT Is Available in Your Region

 Even if you can't access ChatGPT, there's a chance there's nothing wrong with it. If you travel to a region where ChatGPT isn't available, you'll get the "OpenAI services are not available in your country" message.

 The same goes if you're using a VPN and have set your virtual location to a country where ChatGPT isn't available. If you're unsure whether the AI tool is available in your country, you can check [ChatGPT's Supported Countries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).

## 3\. Check OpenAI Twitter

 When there's a problem with OpenAI servers, it's usually announced on the [OpenAI Twitter account](https://twitter.com/OpenAI). So, it's wise to follow their account and check it if you suspect ChatGPT has stopped working.

 Also, they put out an announcement once they fix the problem, so you should turn on Twitter notifications on your phone.
