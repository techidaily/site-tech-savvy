## Making Your ChatGPT Talks Accessible to All

 Before now, sharing ChatGPT conversations was cumbersome as the only option was taking screenshots or copying and paste of chats and conversations.

 OpenAI announced a new ChatGPT feature called **Shared Links**, allowing you to easily share your conversations and chats via social media, email, and other mediums. You can also continue a conversation when you receive a shared link.

 The URL for shared links usually looks like this: <https://chat.openai.com/share/><conversation-ID>

 Anyone with access to your shared link and a ChatGPT account can continue the conversation and ask their follow-up questions. The conversation appears as a static webpage for those without an account, but they can still view conversations between you and the AI chatbot.

 Conversations continued after the link is shared won’t be automatically updated to the public link. So, if you want to share updated content, you will have to reshare the link.

## How to Delete and Make Your Shared Links Inaccessible

 Besides [sending the link anonymously](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-send-completely-anonymous-emails/), you can delete shared links if you don't want others to open them anymore. Here's how to delete your shared links:

1. Click on your name on the bottom-left of the page and click **Settings** from the menu.  
![Screenshot showing ChatGPT settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2023-06-04-172600.jpg)
2. Go to **Data Controls** and click **Manage**. You will see a list of your shared links here.

 You've now rendered the link inaccessible to others. Since the shared link is public and conversations can be continued, deleting it might not affect anyone accessing the link if they have continued the conversation on their own ChatGPT account.

## Easily Share Your ChatGPT Conversations

 By introducing **Shared Links**, OpenAI has made sharing and collaborating on ChatGPT conversations easy. If you cannot access this feature, note that OpenAI is still rolling it out for all users, and it will be made available to everyone on the web version.

 The feature was first rolled out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, who get early access to new features. But does that mean the subscription is worth getting?
