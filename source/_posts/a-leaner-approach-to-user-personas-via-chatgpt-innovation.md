## A Leaner Approach to User Personas via ChatGPT Innovation

 ChatGPT is great at answering queries. It even allows you to get tailored responses with the help of user personas. This is when you ask the chatbot to role-play as a certain individual, and then answer your questions like the persona would.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 But you need to provide a lot of information, like the personaâ€™s identity, speaking style, history, and emotions if you want the AI to accurately role-play the character you have in mind. Here are all the things you need to do when creating user personas in ChatGPT to get better results from the AI.

## 1\. Identify and Convey the Purpose of the Persona

![setting the persona's purpose](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-purpose.jpeg)

 First and foremost, you must identify the purpose of your ChatGPT persona. Try answering questions like what will the persona be used for, and what it'll help you achieve. A purpose will go a long way in customizing any future responses you get in the chat thread.

 For instance, you may want the AI to impersonate a historical figure and give life lessons. Or, you can [use ChatGPT as a video game scriptwriter](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-as-game-scriptwriter/), and ask the AI to role-play as one of your created characters.

 With a persona decided, convey it to the chatbot. Tell ChatGPT something like, "I want to create a persona whose purpose is to \[detail the purpose here\]. Please act out this persona according to the information I provide next." This will give you a starting point for building the whole character.

## 2\. Give the Persona an Identity

![setting the persona's identity](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-identity.jpeg)

 Now, it is time to flesh out the personal details of the user persona by giving the AI an identity. You can start off by assigning it a name. This will become the persona's core identity, and it'll be used to address ChatGPT.

 You also need to convey the role and profession of the persona. This could be a teacher, a leader, a CEO or even your personal assistant. Next, convey the persona's behavioral traits and attitudes. For instance, the user persona can be polite, confident, or witty.

 Give the persona the behavior and attitude that fits in with its purpose, its core identity, and your preferences. To further flesh out the persona, you can also give it likes, dislikes, beliefs, values, aspirations, goals, and ideals. This will give the AI more to work with, and the responses will be more tailored.

## 3\. Dictate Its Speaking Style

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![setting the persona's speaking style](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-speaking-style.jpeg)

 You should also consider giving the new persona a unique speaking style. This could be certain linguistic traits. The latter can be in the form of a verbal tick or a certain slur across sentences.

 The persona can also be designed to incorporate exclamations and certain emotions in its responses, or end its sentences with a catchphrase. There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to dictating the speaking style of a ChatGPT persona. So you should have no trouble giving your persona the voice you want.

## 4\. Establish the Persona's Past and Relationships

![setting the persona's past](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-past.jpeg)

 To further build upon the persona, you need to give it a history. Answer questions like where and when the character was born, where they live, and how qualified they are.

 Other than that, you should convey some important experiences the persona has had in its life. This could be a near-death experience or a certain milestone in a relationship. Speaking of relationships, you can have the user persona linked to other virtual or real-life characters.

 You can even create relationships between different personas that you have made. This will help you weave intricate links between a whole cast of personas that the AI can act out and switch between at your instructions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Indicate the Persona's Emotions

![giving the persona emotions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-emotion.jpeg)

 If you like, you can also indicate the emotional state that the user persona is usually in. From enthusiasm and liveliness to anger and gloominess, these emotions will greatly affect how ChatGPT responds and behaves to your prompts.

 You can also assign multiple emotions to a persona or give it an emotional range that the AI can switch between as it sees fit. Furthermore, you can tell the AI to switch between certain emotions for the persona depending on the topic that is being discussed.

## 6\. Detail the Context

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![setting the persona's context](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-context.jpeg)

 Another important piece of information you need to provide while creating a persona is the context. This is the kind of setting (physical place and situation) the persona is currently in.

 The physical setting can be as detailed as you like. For instance, the new user persona can be in their office or at a restaurant. You can even detail the backdrop of the scene, like where the location is and what its surroundings look like.

 The situation is what the user persona is doing in the physical setting. For example, the persona can be typing in their office or dining in the restaurant. The situation can further be detailed by populating it with the actions of the people currently around the persona.

## 7\. Tell ChatGPT to Take on the Persona and Test It

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![testing the persona](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/persona-testing.jpeg)

 With all the information provided, it's time to test out the persona. Tell ChatGPT to take on the persona you have just created. Then, ask questions and give relevant prompts to see if the AI responds to your liking.

 If the chatbot isn't acting out the persona correctly, you can give it further guidance on how to behave and respond. This way, you can fine-tune the persona until it is exactly how you want it to be.

 It's worth noting that the chatbot's answers won't always be accurate. This is one of the [big problems with OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/). These responses may even reinforce stereotypes, and be offensive and misleading. So, don't take advice from the bot, and consider only using these user personas for creative uses.

## User Personas Can Make ChatGPT More Useful

 Creating a persona with ChatGPT is not at all difficult if you provide ample information to it. First, tell the chatbot the purpose and identity of the persona. Then, flesh it out by giving the user persona a past, a speaking style, behavior, characteristics, emotions, and relationships.

 Finally, provide the context of the persona, and you can now get tailored responses to your questions. But no matter how much information you provide the AI, there are certain topics it will not be able to cover.
