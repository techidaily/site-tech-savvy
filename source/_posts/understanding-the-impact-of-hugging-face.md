 Hugging Face is a company and open-source community focused on the field of artificial intelligence. Like GitHub, Hugging Face provides a platform for people to collaborate, learn, and share work in [natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/). At its core, Hugging Face aims to provide people with all the essential tools, libraries, and resources needed to work on NLP models for their benefit.

 Before becoming a platform for AI, Hugging Face was first introduced as a chatbot in 2016 to entertain and provide emotional support for teenagers. The Hugging Face brand came from the hugging face emoji to look caring and friendly for the teens trying to chat with it. To this day, Hugging Face has kept its branding even though it switched from a chatbot app for mobile to the large community it is today.

## What Is Hugging Face Used For?

 Aside from [providing an AI chatbot you can play with](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-huggingchat/), Hugging Face serves a multitude of purposes in the reams of NLP and computer vision, such as:

1. **Model Hub:** The Hugging Face Model allows members to host model checkpoints for convenient storage and sharing. Members can also download pre-trained models for finetuning and use Hugging Face's Inference API to use models in a production environment.
2. **Tokenizers:** Hugging Face provides tokenizers to break down data into smaller units so that computers can understand and process data effectively. The platform offers tokenization libraries for multiple languages, making it easier to prepare text data as input to train or infer a model.
3. **Spaces:** If you are looking for a place to get new ideas for your next ML project, Hugging Face's Spaces allows members to host machine-learning applications for anyone to try. These apps can be anything from chatbots, AI comic factories, music generators, games, and code generators. With thousands of ML apps to try, you'll surely find one that piques your interest.
4. **Datasets:** Having a high-quality dataset is an essential part of training an effective model. Hugging Face allows members to share and download data sets for anyone to improve and use in projects.
5. **Education:** Hugging Face provides members with all the essential tools and assets to train and use models. This would include providing demos, use cases, documentation, and tutorials on how to use such tools and how to train models from start to finish.

 Hugging Face's comprehensive set of tools has helped push it to the top of the pile.
