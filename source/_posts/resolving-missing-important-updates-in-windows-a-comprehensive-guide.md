There are other ways to resolve this issue, and we’ll show you how to apply them.

##  1\. Use Windows Update Assistant

##  2\. Clear Your Windows Update Cache

 If your downloaded update files are corrupted, that can cause issues updating your system. In this case, clear your Windows Update cache, and your issue should be resolved.

 Windows will re-download any required update files, so you don’t lose anything permanently when you clear your update cache.

 To start, launch the Run dialog box by pressing Windows+R. Here, type the following command and press Enter:

services.msc

 On the "Services" window, find the service named "Windows Update". Right-click it and choose "Stop". You’re doing this because Windows won’t let you delete your update files if this service is running. Keep the "Services" window open, as you’ll return to it shortly.

 Now, open the Run dialog box again, enter the following in the field, and press Enter:

C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\

Here, [select all available files](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-effective-strategies-to-capture-and-save-google-voice-dialogues-for-2024/) by pressing Ctrl+A. Then, right-click a selected file and choose "Delete". This deletes all your update cache files.

 Make sure to [empty your Recycle Bin](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-effortless-guide-to-designing-youtube-follow-links/) after deleting the above files. Then, return to the "Services" window, right-click "Windows Update", and select "Start".

 To now update your PC, head into Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and find and install the available updates.

##  3\. Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 If your issue persists, something else may be wrong with Windows Update. In this case, use your PC’s built-in Windows Update troubleshooter to automatically find and fix issues with your updates. Only a little interaction is required from your end.

 To run that tool, go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional Troubleshooters > Windows Update and click "Run the Troubleshooter".

!['Run the Troubleshooter' highlighted for the 'Windows Update' troubleshooter.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-launch-windows-update-troubleshooter.jpg) 

 Wait for the tool to detect and resolve your update problems. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, then restart your PC.

##  4\. Fix Windows’ Corrupted System Files

 If Windows’ core files are corrupted, that can cause your various system features to malfunction, including Windows Update. In this case, use your PC’s built-in SFC (System File Checker) tool to [find and repair all the damaged system files on your computer](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/twirl-forge-instruments-for-2024/).

 To use the tool, open your PC’s Start Menu, find "Command Prompt", and select "Run as Administrator".

!['Run as Administrator' highlighted for Command Prompt in the Start Menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5-open-cmd-as-admin.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 In the "User Account Control" prompt, choose "Yes".

 On the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter. This will download the files needed to fix your corrupted files.

DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth

 Next up, run the following command to begin finding and fixing your system’s damaged files:

sfc /scannow

 Wait while the command does its job, then reboot your PC.
