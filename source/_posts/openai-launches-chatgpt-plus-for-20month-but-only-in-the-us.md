 The new ChatGPT Plus pilot plan went live on February 1st, 2023, and is only available to US residents at the time of writing.

 However, the new premium ChatGPT tier doesn't spell the end of the free version of ChatGPT, which OpenAI will keep up and running alongside the paid version.

## OpenAI Launches Its Pilot Subscription Plan for ChatGPT

 A paid-for,[premium version of ChatGPT was inevitable](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-paid-chatgpt-professional-is-inevitable/) . In January 2023, OpenAI revealed it was working on ChatGPT Professional, a premium version of its AI tool aimed at businesses and other organizations.

 Now, OpenAI has revealed [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) , its new subscription plan that will cost $20/month.

 Subscribing to ChatGPT comes with a few key benefits, according to OpenAI, including:

* Faster ChatGPT access, even during peak periods
* Faster ChatGPT response times
* Priority access to new ChatGPT features and improvements

 At the time of writing, ChatGPT Plus is only available for US residents, and if you want to use it, you'll have to use the [ChatGPT Plus Waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScee6ST3o-kZDjlw1ROfUNyjuRBwGdcoewxjCULNejbP5hdzQ/viewform) to register your interest.

## OpenAI Confirms Its Free ChatGPT Tier Will Remain

 ChatGPT has been a roaring success for OpenAI, and there are [heaps of things you can do with its AI-powered tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/) .

 Currently, ChatGPT is freeâ€”and the good news is that OpenAI is keeping it that way. Indeed, the new subscription tier will enable OpenAI to keep the free ChatGPT option available.

> We love our free users and will continue to offer free access to ChatGPT. By offering this subscription pricing, we will be able to help support free access availability to as many people as possible.

 Whether the introduction of the ChatGPT Plus subscription tier results in a downgraded service for free users remains to be seen, but in theory, offering high-demand users the option to move to a premium tier with better service will free up the free service for more occasional users.

## OpenAI Will Launch Additional Premium ChatGPT Options in the Future

 A subscription ChatGPT tier was always on the cards, and it seems OpenAI is also considering additional plans in the future.

> We are actively exploring options for lower-cost plans, business plans, and data packs for more availability

 Given the popularity of ChatGPT and the numerous ways the tool is being used and integrated into other services, it's no wonder OpenAI is exploring every monetization avenue possible.

 For now, US residents can sign up for the ChatGPT Plus waitlist for a chance to use the premium tier, while the rest of the world will have to wait patiently.
