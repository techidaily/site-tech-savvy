4. Install the new driver and restart your computer to apply the changes.

### Automatically update your drivers

 If you do not have the time or patience to update your drivers manually or you think it is error-prone, you can utilize an**automatic driver updater** – **[Drive Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help you automatically identify any missing or outdated driver, and install the most updated one, direct from the manufacturers. With Driver Easy, having driver updates is just a matter of a few mouse clicks.

## 2\. Ensure your system is optimized

 While various factors can contribute to these problems, one often overlooked aspect is the operating system itself. Many users might be running outdated Windows versions, which could significantly impact their game graphics and overall performance.

 Besides, Windows updates bring bug fixes, and performance optimizations, ensuring smoother gameplay and enhanced graphics.

 To get the latest Windows updates and mitigate your FPS drops and stuttering issues, take these steps:  
 (Note: Screenshots below come from Windows 10\. If you’re running Windows 11, your screen might look slightly different. )

1. In the Search box, type **check for updates** . Then click **Check for updates**  from the results.  

![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/check-for-updates.png)
2. Click on the **Check for updates**  button. Windows will then search for available updates. If there are any updates available, it’ll automatically start to download and install it. Simply wait for the process to complete. Then restart your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/click-on-the-Check-for-updates-tab.png)

 After the reboot, relaunch your game and check your gaming performance. If your FPS still drops bafflingly, don’t fret! Below are some other methods you can try.

## 3\. Disable background applications

 Background applications can consume system resources and lead to FPS drops. Close unnecessary programs running in the background, particularly those utilizing high CPU or GPU usage, such as video players or web browsers with multiple tabs.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and hit Enter to open the Task Manager.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Click on the**Processes** tab. Observe the**CPU** and**GPU** columns to identify any processes consuming a significant amount of resources.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Then restart your game and test your gameplay.

## 4\. Scan and repair your game files

 Game files may get corrupted or damaged over time due to reasons like improper installations, sudden system crashes, or file conflicts. Such issues can result in performance problems during gameplay, including FPS drops and stuttering. Scanning and repairing game files can detect and fix these corrupt or missing files, restoring the game to its original state and potentially resolving performance-related problems.

 And Blizzard’s Battle.net client allows you to verify the integrity of game files and repair them:

1. Open your Battle.net desktop app.
2. Click on your game icon.
3. Click the**cogwheel** next to the**Play button** and select**Scan and Repair** .  
 (If your game is not up-to-date, you should select**Check for Updates** first. )  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/diablo-4-scan-and-repair-game-files.png)
4. Click**Begin Scan** and wait for the process to complete. Then restart the Battle.net desktop app and launch your game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Adjust your in-game settings

 When it comes to troubleshooting graphics issues, adjusting in-game settings may help.

 Windowed Display Mode can potentially help with FPS drops and stuttering in games like Diablo 4\. This mode allows the game to run in a window rather than in full-screen mode.

 In addition, we suggest you disable V-Sync. V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization) synchronizes the game’s frame rate with your monitor’s refresh rate. While V-Sync can eliminate screen tearing, it can also contribute to FPS drops and stuttering.

To use Windowed mode and turn off Vertical Sync, take these steps:

1. Launch your game and open the menu.
2. Select**OPTIONS** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/diablo-4-menu-options.png)
3. Under the**GRAPHICS** section, select**Windowed (Fullscreen)** from the dropdown. Then scroll down and find**Vertical Syncb** . Make sure it’s off.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/diablo-4-adjust-in-game-settings.png)

After applying changes, relaunch your game and check if it works.

## 6\. Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling

 Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling is a feature introduced in Windows 10 version 2004 and later. It allows the GPU to manage its video memory directly. And that can reduce the burden on the CPU and potentially improve graphics performance in games and applications.

 To enable it and enjoy the benefits that can help address FPS drops and stuttering issues, follow these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Then enter**graphics settings** in the search box. Click**Graphics settings** from the search results.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
2. Toggle on**Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![enable hardware-acceleration GPU scheduling](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/turn-on-hardware-accelerated-GPU-scheduling.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214" border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Restart your computer to apply the changes.

## 7\. Repair missing or corrupted system files

 If all else fails, it’s suggested that you check if any of your system files are missing or corrupted.

 System files are essential components of your operating system that ensure its proper functioning. Over time, these files can become corrupted, damaged, or even go missing due to various reasons, such as software conflicts, unexpected shutdowns, or malware infections. When system files are compromised, it can negatively impact your computer’s performance, including causing FPS drops and stuttering during gameplay.

 In such a case, should repair missing or corrupted system files. You can do this using the built-in Windows utility called**System File Checker (SFC)** .

### Run the System File Checker

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Type**cmd** in the search bar. Then right-click on**Command Prompt** from the search results and select**Run as administrator** .  

![run command prompt as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cmd-run-as-administrator.jpg)
