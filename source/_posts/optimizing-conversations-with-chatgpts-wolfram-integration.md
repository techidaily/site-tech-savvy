 Despite being one of the best AI chatbots in the market, ChatGPT, on its own, is limited in many ways. From being constrained by the limits of its knowledge base to being prone to generating inaccurate information, ChatGPT needs improvement in several areas.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 However, while the AI chatbot continues to evolve and improve, there are some ChatGPT plugins that can effectively plug some of ChatGPT's most pressing performance gaps. The Wolfram Alpha plugin is one such plugin. Here are three ways to make the most of the ChatGPT Wolfram plugin.

 On March 19, 2024, [OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta) conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024\. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in [custom GPTs and the GPT Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/).

## 1\. Fact-Checking Information

 One of the best use cases for the Wolfram plugin is for fact-checking content. While ChatGPT is limited by its somewhat static knowledge base and is likely to mix up facts, the Wolfram plugin is powered by a carefully curated and constantly updated database of vetted data.

 This means you can run any claims in your ChatGPT-generated content against the more carefully curated Wolfram database to ensure accuracy. How can you do this?

 Simply paste the text of the content you want to fact-check or provide a link to it and ask ChatGPT to invoke the Wolfram plugin to fact-check it. In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to use the plugin to fact-check some information about the solar system we copied online.

![fact-checking scientific claims with Wolfram plugin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fact-checking-scientific-claims-with-wolfram-plugin.jpg)

 After running the claims against its database, Wolfram made the following conclusions:

![results of scientific fact-checking](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/results-of-scientific-fact-checking.jpg)

 As seen in the results above, the Wolfram plugin can run checks by using its own knowledge base. It is particularly useful when using ChatGPT to generate content in areas like mathematics, geography, history, chemistry, and physics.

 Apart from copy-pasting text into ChatGPT, you can simply provide the plugin with links to web pages containing the text you wish to fact-check. So, instead of simply pasting the text to fact-check or asking it to fact-check a ChatGPT response, you can ask something like this:

`The article in the URL (https://www.funkidslive.com/learn/top-10-facts/top-10-facts-about-pluto/) makes several claims about the planet Pluto, fact-check all the claims step by step.`

 To fact-check a remote resource, you'd need to activate the Link Reader plugin to pair with Wolfram. Alternatively, to fact-check a PDF, you'll need to pair Wolfram with a PDF reader plugin. You'll find both the Link Reader and Chat With PDF plugins on the ChatGPT plugin store.

## 2\. Solve Complex STEM Problems

 ChatGPT is considerably good at handling STEM-related problems. This is quite apparent in its mathematical abilities. However, [ChatGPT still falls short in a lot of ways](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/), especially in handling complex, unconventional mathematics problems.

 One of Wolfram's biggest selling points is its computation abilities. The Wolfram plugin will typically be able to handle a lot of the math problems that ChatGPT might have a hard time knitting together.

 Also, in many cases, Wolfram can solve problems with more precision and can express the results in different formats. From line graphs to bar charts and pie charts, the Wolfram plugin can handle many more nuances of mathematics than ChatGPT can.

 In the example below, we asked ChatGPT to invoke the Wolfram plugin to solve: **Given f(x) = 3x, g(x) = x^2-3, and h\[x\] = x^3, what is the area between f(x) and g(x)**​​​​​​.

![The Wolfram ChatGPT plugin does math](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wolfram-does-maths.jpg)

 Wolfram was able to solve the problem with precision while also generating a corresponding graph. It is important to note that ChatGPT without plugins has a hard time solving this same problem and can not generate graphs.

 Wolfram, on the other hand, is quite impressive in generating mathematical graphics of any kind.

![Wolfram plugin creates a Bar chart with ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wolfram-plugin-creates-a-bar-chart-with-chatgpt.jpg)

 Beyond mathematical graphs, Wolfram can generate infographics of different kinds. We were able to create everything from spectrograms and complex 3D plots to scatter graphs and convex hulls. For dealing with complex engineering problems that might need graphical representation, the Wolfram plugin is unrivalled.

 Of course, beyond mathematics, Wolfram can outperform ChatGPT in solving a range of other STEM-related problems. From physics and chemistry to geology, astronomy, and geography, Wolfram makes ChatGPT so much better at dealing with STEM problems.

 Whenever you're dealing with problems in any of these fields, and you need your content to be as factual as possible, consider using the Wolfram plugin.

 Sometimes, ChatGPT might choose not to use Wolfram for STEM questions, but for improved accuracy, you can force it to do so by explicitly requesting the chatbot to use the plugin. If you're not sure how to set up ChatGPT plugins, here's an explainer on [how to set up and start using ChatGPT plugins](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/).

## 3\. Data Analysis

 ChatGPT, especially when backed by the GPT-4 model, has quite some impressive data analysis abilities. However, the Wolfram plugin can significantly improve those abilities.

 Wolfram's ability to generate graphs of different kinds means you can analyze and summarize data in dozens and represent them in dozens of possible infographics formats without the limits of ChatGPT itself.

## Embrace the Wolfram Plugin for ChatGPT

 ChatGPT, despite its phenomenal abilities, is not perfect. While the AI chatbot continues to iterate and improve, you can make the best of ChatGPT by taking advantage of the extra abilities that plugins bring to the table.

 If you want to ameliorate the problem of inaccuracies while extending ChatGPT's abilities to create infographics, then you should definitely try out the Wolfram plugin. But does ChatGPT work better with plugins, or when it can roam the web?

 Despite being one of the best AI chatbots in the market, ChatGPT, on its own, is limited in many ways. From being constrained by the limits of its knowledge base to being prone to generating inaccurate information, ChatGPT needs improvement in several areas.
