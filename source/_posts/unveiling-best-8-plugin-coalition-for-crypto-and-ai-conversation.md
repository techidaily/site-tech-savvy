 Nevertheless, you can make the adventure much more enjoyable if you take advantage of several tools. For instance, these ChatGPT crypto plugins can help you with almost every information-based need.

 So, what are the best crypto plugins for ChatGPT, and what do they do?

 On March 19, 2024, [OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta) conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024\. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in [custom GPTs and the GPT Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/).

## 1\. Crypto Jobs List

 The Crypto Jobs List plugin is designed to assist users in finding jobs in the crypto industry. Created by [Crypto Jobs List](https://cryptojobslist.com/), a Web3 talent sourcing company, the plugin fetches data on job opportunities and descriptions from the website and uses it to locate job opportunities. It allows you to interact with it to find specific job roles, learn about required qualifications, and gain insights into the crypto job market. You can specify your location, niche, and even salary range to get a list of job opportunities that match your preference. For instance, we used the tool to find a couple of remote cryptocurrency content-writing jobs.

 While Crypto Jobs List is a good plugin to start with when searching for jobs, you'd benefit even more by using a general plugin like Job Search by Indeed, which has a larger database of jobs spanning all industries, including cryptocurrency.

## 2\. CCData.io

 The CCData.io plugin is designed to provide real-time and historical data on various cryptocurrencies. It's powered by [CCData](https://ccdata.io/), an online platform launched in 2014 to provide institutions with actionable data on digital assets.

It works with Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism blockchains providing users with real-time information using Alchemy's Web3 APIs.

Also, the plugin is trained on a fixed set of API methods rather than real-time off-chain data.

 We tried to find out the current gas fee for sending $100 worth of ETH, and the above response is what we got. The tool noted that [Ethereum gas fees](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees-why-so-high/) don't depend on the amount being traded but on the network conditions.

[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)'s ChatGPT plugin is a tool that allows users to access blockchain data. It works with Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism blockchains providing users with real-time information using Alchemy's Web3 APIs. You can access account balances, tokens metadata, block information, and fee data pegged on network conditions. Due to the character limitations of ChatGPT, the plugin responds within the limitation. Also, the plugin is trained on a fixed set of API methods rather than real-time off-chain data.

 Nevertheless, you can make the adventure much more enjoyable if you take advantage of several tools. For instance, these ChatGPT crypto plugins can help you with almost every information-based need.

 So, what are the best crypto plugins for ChatGPT, and what do they do?

 On March 19, 2024, [OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta) conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024\.

![A screenshot of Crypto Jobs List plugin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-jobs-list.jpg)
