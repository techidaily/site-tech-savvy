## Multi-Modal AI and DIY: What Is a Multi-Modal AI?

![An electric bulb on a black chalkboard with chat bubbles](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bulb-on-chalkboard.jpg)

 Multi-modal AI refers to AI models that can process and understand different types of data, such as text, images, and videos. Get this, if GPT-4 becomes a multi-modal AI, it will be a game changer for DIY enthusiasts.

 This means that GPT-4 could potentially generate DIY project ideas based on visual input, such as a user's uploaded images of materials or finished projects.

 It could also provide step-by-step instructions that incorporate both text and visual cues, making it easier for users to follow along. With multi-modal capabilities, GPT-4 could open up a whole new world of possibilities for DIY enthusiasts looking to take on more complex projects.
