## Mastering Safe Use of Deep Learning Algos

 Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, can be effective, everyday assistants that help you optimize your workflow. However, whether you use it as a writing, coding, or research assistant, it's important to know they are far from perfect.

## 1\. Not Understanding How Generative AI Tools Work

![ChatGPT screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/how-chatgpt-works.jpg)

 While you don't need to be a machine learning or AI expert to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, Copysmith, etc., having a basic understanding of how they work is vital. This helps you appreciate their limitations and find ways to get better results.

 Although these AI text generators have some differences, most use the same underlying engine, so understanding how one works can also give you a pretty accurate view of how the others work. So, [how does ChatGPT work?](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/)

 ChatGPT is a large language model trained on massive amounts of data from the internet and other sources. This AI chatbot relies on this training to generate human-sounding responses to your queries. It is worth noting that some of these AI text generators, including ChatGPT, have a training cutoff date, which means they lack knowledge of events after this date.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Not Editing Responses From AI Text Generators

 The next big mistake to avoid when using AI-generative tools is failing to edit their responses. By editing, we don't just mean correcting spelling or grammar mistakes. You also need to fact-check the information generated and compare it to other credible sources.

 As we have covered above, some of these tools don't have access to current information. So, while AI chatbots are effective at predicting their next words (based on their training data and your prompt) and generating plausible and human-like responses, their output is not always accurate, and that's one of the [biggest problems with OpenAI's ChatGPT.](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/)

 In addition, these tools may have been fed with biased information and could also generate biased responses. So, you should always ensure you review and edit the generated content before using it.

## 3\. Over-Relying on Generative AI Tools for Your Writing Tasks

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631056&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/997e65474a248252883b485717f7d098/products/buy-windows.png" border="0">Allavsoft Batch Download Online Videos, Music Offline to MP4, MP3, MOV, etc format </a>

![A woman using a computer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ai-tools-writing.jpg)

 Although these AI writing tools can help you write entire articles for online publishers or write your school essays from scratch, developing an over-reliance on them is a huge mistake. There are [several reasons why content writers should not rely on AI chatbots](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-content-writers-cant-rely-ai-chatbots/) for their daily writing tasks.

 First, as we have covered, these tools don't guarantee accuracy and may contain factual errors or biased content. In addition, these AI writing tools typically generate bland, generic, formulaic content that lacks sufficient depth and creativity. Lastly, an over-dependence on these tools will kill your creativity and make you lazy.

 This is not to say you shouldn't use them at all, as there are [several responsible ways to use AI as a content writer](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-use-ai-as-writer-editor/), including brainstorming titles or content ideas, researching, crafting catchy headlines, and more.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Failing to Write Good Prompts

 For the most part, the quality of the responses you get from ChatGPT and similar tools depends on the quality of their training and your prompts. In the most basic terms, prompting is how humans talk to AIs, so adopting good [prompting techniques is an effective way to improve your ChatGPT responses](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/).

 For instance, it's always good to ensure your prompts are clear and grammatically correct. Next, you want to provide enough information and context for the AI to understand your query. In addition, you can also assign it a role to get more specific and relevant responses.

 All in all, learning how to write effective prompts is a key skill to master when using generative AI tools. You can continuously practice by interacting with the AI and adjusting your prompts as you go—you never know, you may just [start a career in prompt engineering](https://www.makeuseof.com/career-in-prompt-engineering/).

## 5\. Trusting Generative AI Tools With Sensitive Information

![A top secret report](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/top-secret-information.jpg)

 Similar to other Tech Giants, OpenAI has faced criticism over its data collection practices that put user privacy and security at risk. However, this goes beyond the account information you give when signing up (name, transaction history, payment card information, etc.), as it also includes data from your conversations with the chatbot.

 This includes everything you type into the chatbot field or file uploads. That said, [you shouldn't trust ChatGPT with confidential information](https://www.makeuseof.com/shouldnt-trust-chatgpt-confidential-data/) because it could end up in the wrong hands. This is a serious concern, as countries like [Italy have already banned ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-has-italy-banned-chatgpt/), and it's safe to assume that other AI generative tools have similar data collection practices.

 That said, you should always remain mindful when using these tools and ensure you do not input sensitive or confidential information.

## 6\. Using Generative AI Tools Unethically

 Like most tools out there, AI content generators can be used for good and malicious purposes. For instance, some students have been using AI chatbots to cheat in school, while other malicious actors use them to write phishing emails or create malware.

 In addition, it's also good practice to inform clients/readers when using AI-generated content in your work. This is particularly important when it comes to sensitive topics like health, politics, and finance.

 Lastly, you also want to keep an eye on the Terms of Use of any AI content generator you use to ensure you're not violating them, as this could result in your account being suspended or banned.

![A close up view of a computer with "ChatGPT Prompts" written on it](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-prompt-ai.jpg)

 A lot has been said about artificial intelligence recently, and several predictions have been made as well. Whether you believe that these tools will take your job or not, what's certain is that [AI will change the job market](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-change-job-market/), and it's here to stay.

 This means adaptability is more vital than ever, so ignoring these AI generative tools is a mistake you want to avoid. While you may have unique skills and talents that artificial intelligence can't replace, there's a huge chance that early adopters will gain an edge over their competition.

## Get Better Results From Generative AI Tools by Avoiding These Mistakes

 AI chatbots can enhance your workday in several ways, but like most tools, you need to know how to use them properly to get the best results. By avoiding these mistakes, you'll be able to make the most out of generative AI tools and ensure that your work is of the highest quality.

 As this technology continues to evolve, it's vital to continuously refine your skills to stay ahead of the curve. And once you can use these tools effectively, make sure that you use them to their full advantage and boost your own productivity.
