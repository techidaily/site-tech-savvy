Businesses continue to [invest heavily in digital transformation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-enterprise-plans-to-increase-ai-spending-next-year/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-enterprise-plans-to-increase-ai-spending-next-year/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22invest%20heavily%20in%20digital%20transformation%22%7D), and the CIO is one of the big beneficiaries. Companies need the specialized advice of a knowledgeable digital leader to ensure the organization gets the most bang for its buck.

Research conducted by the consulting company Deloitte shows that the CIO role is being elevated to a higher status. With [nearly two-thirds (63%) of technology leaders](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/cio-perspectives-new-deloitte-survey-unveils-technology-leaders-current-priorities-performance-and-competencies.html#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/cio-perspectives-new-deloitte-survey-unveils-technology-leaders-current-priorities-performance-and-competencies.html%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22nearly%20two-thirds%20%2863%%29%20of%20technology%20leaders%22%7D) saying they now report directly to the CEO, the consultant refers to this period as a "golden" era for the CIO.

## 1\. Show up as a business leader

Anjali Shaikh, managing director and CIO Program Experience director at Deloitte Consulting LLP, said there's never been a more exciting time to be a CIO.

"While the role of technology within business has increased over the last several years, the impact and value CIOs can bring are more apparent today than ever," she said.

"Technology is at the center of the organization, and keeping up with this pace of change is simply another requirement of the role."

Shaikh said the increased recognition of the role of technology presents an opportunity many CIOs have been waiting for.

However, she told ZDNET that delivering value is a "tough job" and advised would-be digital leaders to hone their skills in several key areas.

"While there is more pressure for CIOs to step outside of the comfort of a purely technical role, it's further proof of the value of technology, and they are being asked to expand on that technical foundation and show up as a business leader," she said.

"They'll need to focus on improving their communication skills, building strong collaborative relationships throughout the organization, and thoroughly understanding the industry and the organization's needs and goals to bring value to all business areas."

## 2\. Build strong relationships with people

Omer Grossman, global CIO at technology specialist CyberArk, says smart digital leaders can change the business but must concentrate on the right areas.

Grossman told ZDNET that too many tech managers still focus on IT rather than what he refers to as the underlying information part of the role.

"If you fully utilize your CIO position to encompass accountability for information, then you're on the right path. Otherwise, you won't survive," he said.

While making the most of technology is still a big part of the CIO role, Grossman said your long-term success as a digital leader will depend on your people skills.

"You must build relationships. You want to be a trusted adviser and partner," he said.

"You need to manage your relationships and build them. You can buy a great solution, but you won't be able to implement it successfully if your users reject it. Success is all about people."

## 3\. Boost your diversity and sustainability smarts

Bev White, CEO at global recruiter Nash Squared, said the digital leadership role is in an almost constant state of flux -- and that's a good thing.

"The CIO role has changed probably more than any other senior position over the last 10 to 15 years," she said, suggesting the speed of the technology evolution has continued to increase since cloud computing was first adopted.

"CIOs have had to deal with a landscape of rapid and constant change -- and this rate of change has sped up recently with the arrival of artificial intelligence."

Like other experts, White told ZDNET there's never been a more exciting time to be a CIO.

However, she also said successful CIOs will need to rise to the challenges of modern digital leadership. Her firm's research suggests [CIOs could increase their focus on two key areas](https://www.nashsquared.com/dlr-pulse-survey-2024/dlr-pulse-survey-2024#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.nashsquared.com/dlr-pulse-survey-2024/dlr-pulse-survey-2024%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22CIOs%20could%20increase%20their%20focus%20on%20two%20key%20areas%22%7D): diversity and sustainability.

"In both areas, most of the CIOs in our Pulse survey -- 72% and 68% respectively -- report that progress has stayed the same as six months ago," she said.

"But in two key strategic areas, standing still means falling back. There is room for CIOs to increase the momentum here and set the standards to inspire others in the business."

## 4\. Work hand in glove with your peers

Sasha Jory, CIO at insurer Hastings Direct, said the definition of a [successful digital leader](https://www.zdnet.com/article/it-strategy-how-to-be-an-influential-digital-leader/) has changed, and up-and-coming IT professionals must concentrate on collaboration.

"In the past, you had senior people who knew the technology strategy, waved their arms, and had armies of people to implement things and turn their ideas into reality," she said.

"Now, you must be a CIO who understands the business, your customers, and the technology, and you must surround yourself with people who are motivated, agile, and able to deliver."

Jory told ZDNET this change in the type of person who becomes a credible digital leader means there are new opportunities for IT professionals to engage with their business peers on a level playing field.

"If you're on an island, you won't be successful. The route for a successful CIO is to be collaborative and engaged with everybody so that they can deliver the right outcomes," she said.

"I don't believe you can lead technology transformation without working hand in glove with your business."

## 5\. Stay abreast of emerging technologies

JP Avelange, CIO for technology specialist Expereo, said the expanding compass of the CIO position means career-oriented IT professionals must be prepared to step into new areas.

"The roles and responsibilities of the CIO have changed, driven by the pace of innovation and the increasing role of business units influencing or directly driving tech spending," he said.

"In this new context, CIOs must be seen as business partners and have no choice but to expand their scope and adapt to new demands to stay relevant."

Avelange told ZDNET that CIOs are still expected to take care of the fundamentals, which include leading digital transformation and managing IT budgets effectively.

However, they should also deliver value and justify investments in new technologies and projects.

"The focus of CIOs has expanded to keeping up with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and integrating those technologies into existing systems and processes," he said.

"Many CIOs are spearheading cybersecurity measures, handling the exponential growth of data, and leveraging it for business insights and decision-making."
