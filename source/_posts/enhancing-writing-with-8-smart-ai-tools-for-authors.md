## Enhancing Writing with 8 Smart AI Tools for Authors

 Most content writers are discouraged from using artificial intelligence (AI) in their writing, but AI tools can still be helpful in a content writer's workflow. Whether they’re used for idea generation, transcribing ideas or meetings, proofreading, SEO research, or even as a bounce board, AI can be used without plagiarizing writing content.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Here are eight AI tools to help content writers with their writing workflow. Use them responsibly as an AI assistant and not a writing replacement.

## 1\. Otter AI

 Transcription services can speed up any writer’s workflow, especially if you ever find yourself staring at a blank page because you can’t get the words from your head onto the page or didn’t take comprehensive notes during your meetings. With Otter AI, it can transcribe for you.

 Otter AI uses real-time transcription technology to save you time taking notes. There’s also a built-in collaboration feature to give names to different voices if in a multi-person meeting. You can highlight, comment, or insert images directly to real-time transcribed conversations. Otter AI also highlights keywords, which can be helpful in your writing research.

**Download**: Otter AI for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otter-voice-meeting-notes/id1276437113) | [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2028506/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aisense.otter&pli=1) | [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/otterai-record-and-transc/bnmojkbbkkonlmlfgejehefjldooiedp) (Free, premium subscriptions available)

## 2\. ChatGPT

![ChatGPT generating an article outline.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chat-gpt-article-outline.jpg)

 ChatGPT has been one of the biggest successes of the AI generation. You can use this AI textbot as a tool for your writing, but it comes in handy as a fantastic idea generator.

 If you pride yourself as a content writer, you shouldn’t use ChatGPT to write your content, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be used in other ways. Content creators need a steady flow of new ideas, and sometimes your mind is blank.

 Ask ChatGPT for some writing ideas within your content niche, and then use your writing expertise to expand upon the results. You can also [train ChatGPT to write like you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/) to reflect your personal style.

## 3\. Canva Magic Write

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 As a content writer, you might not be writing your content using Canva, but [Canva Docs offers Magic Write as an AI writing tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-canva-docs/). If your content writing veers closer to general content creation, then Magic Write may be the tool for you.

 Canva Magic Write uses OpenAI technology, so it supplies similar result types to ChatGPT. You can use Magic Write for idea generation, outlines for your content, and paraphrasing, to name a few features. We have a [guide to using Canva Magic Write](https://www.makeuseof.com/canva-how-to-use-magic-write/).

 Magic Write can help summarize documents—this is great for content writers who do their own marketing. You can summarize your larger content articles into social media posts of varying lengths. It also offers language translation which can help when writing to a multilingual audience.

## 4\. Google Bard

![Google Bard chatbot proofreading a paragraph.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-bard-chatbot-proofreader.jpg)

 Google Bard is an AI chatbot, which uses different technology than ChatGPT. Bard can be used as a writing collaborator, allowing you to bounce ideas and cite information in your research, but you can also [use Bard for many other helpful reasons](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-google-bard/).

 Google Bard gives cited answers when it can, and it also provides images with some of its answers. This can help you as a content writer to use authoritative information in your content writing.

 You can also use Google Bard to edit your written content and provide proofreading. This is a great option if you cannot work with an external fact-checker, editor, or proofreader—it offers a budget-friendly alternative that keeps your work being the best it can be.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
[Dropbox introduced its AI toolbox](https://www.makeuseof.com/dropbox-ai-features/), Dropbox Dash, in June 2023 as a beta platform. Although Dropbox itself isn’t a writing tool, and as a content writer, you may overlook it as a helpful tool. Its AI features can be handy for content writers and can be integrated with a myriad of other tools for a smooth workflow.

 Dropbox Dash tools can summarize documents—this will speed up your research time by taking key information from long documents and presenting it in easy-to-digest chunks. You can also directly ask Dropbox Dash a question about information in a document or integrated account, and it will find and present the answer.

 For example, if you need to fact-check a date, you might ask: “When did Elon Musk buy Twitter?”, and Dash can highlight the answer in any uploaded document or connected tab. Great for speeding up research, fact-checking, or organizing your work.

## 6\. Notion AI

![notion ai working on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/notion-ai-working-on-macos.jpg)

 Using Notion in your content creation and writing workflow is already a great idea—you can keep track of projects, create to-do lists, and stay on top of your finances as a freelance content writer.

 Notion AI comes in handy even further for content writers allowing you to translate pages into other languages and write with specific writing tones. This is a helpful tool to guide new content creators in the right direction—think of it like an AI writing mentor. [Notion has some competition with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/notion-ai-vs-chatgpt/), but it has enough of its own unique tools that it’s worth checking out.
