 Whether you're looking for help with a difficult chore, inspiration for a new hobby, advice on improving yourself, or just a good chuckle, ChatGPT can be your trusted ally for anything. Let's look at a few examples and their ChatGPT prompts that will decrease your workload.

## 1\. Simplifying a Large Task

![Screenshot of a ChatGPT interaction](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgptprompt_task_breakdown.jpg)

 A big, complex task might be overwhelming in our busy lives. What always works is to [break down big tasks into smaller chunks](http://www.makeuseof.com/task-management-software-manage-complete-your-tasks/). To reduce your stress, outsource this to ChatGPT! It can easily simplify your daunting task. All you need to do is state your task and ask ChatGPT to simplify it.

### Tips

* Define your task clearly.
* Include relevant information for time-bound tasks.
* Include relevant information for progress monitoring (checkpoints, milestones, etc.).
* Request it to break down any confusing tasks further.
* Ask for clarification if any steps are unclear.

### Example Prompts

* Help me outline a business plan for my startup.
* I want to learn to code in Python. Create a learning plan for the next 30 days.
* I want to write a fiction book. Can you make a step-by-step process for this?
