## 1\. Analyze a Token

* **Prompt**: I'm a crypto investor. I came across a new token that's gaining traction. It's called "Theta Token." Can you help me analyze the utility and value proposition of the token and its underlying blockchain? Describe its key features, use cases, and any unique characteristics that set it apart from other tokens in the market. Additionally, discuss its performance trends over the past six months, considering factors such as market capitalization, trading volume, and community engagement. Provide insights into the token's potential for growth and any challenges it may face in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Break down the analysis into sections for easy reading.

## 2\. Learn to Do Advanced Trading

* **Prompt**: I've been trading cryptocurrencies for a year and saved $10,000\. I want to start doing advanced trading to grow my portfolio to $100,000 within the next year. Help me develop a strategy for the top 10 cryptocurrencies focusing on risk management and maximizing profit potential. Please provide a clear plan that outlines:  
  * Key technical indicators and chart patterns for identifying entry and exit points  
  * Best strategies for risk management and diversification

## 3\. Summarize a Whitepaper

* **Prompt**: Assume I am an 18-year-old with basic computer knowledge. I want to understand Bitcoin's whitepaper. Summarize the key concepts and innovations presented in the paper in an easy-to-read manner. Provide a concise overview of the objectives, technology, and problems it aims to solve. Describe how Bitcoin is intended to be used and how different it is from government currencies and other cryptocurrencies. Ensure the summary is accurate and avoids any ambiguity.
* **Result**:

 With many crypto projects in the market, you don't want to spend thousands of hours going through endless whitepapers. Use this prompt to summarize any crypto whitepaper and get a quick, firm grasp of what the project entails.

## 4\. Review Smart Contracts

 Note that for the following, we tested the source code of a [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa7ca36f7273d4d38fc2aec5a454c497f86728a7a#code) listed on Etherscan.

 This is perhaps one of the most ingenious ways to use ChatGPT in crypto. Considering the many scams in the industry, it's wise to complete a technical analysis of every smart contract you wish to use or participate in. Paste the smart contract into ChatGPT and let it tell you if it's malicious.

## 5\. Get Crypto Terms Explanations

* **Prompt**: Help me understand Zk Rollups. Tell me what they are, how they work, and their benefits and concerns, and list a few examples. Also, how will they impact the blockchain industry in general? Ensure your explanation is simple, clear, and well-structured.

Today courtesy of [Bitcoin ordinals](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-how-differ-from-nfts/), Bitcoin can now support NFTs. Often, you'll come across many such crypto terms that need some explaining, and this prompt helps you to understand them better.

## 6\. Make Investment Strategies

* **Prompt**: I'm interested in earning passive income, and I've opted to invest in crypto staking. Currently, which cryptocurrencies are most secure and offer the most attractive returns? In addition, could you provide a detailed analysis of these cryptocurrencies mentioning their historical annual percentage yield, potential risks, token lockup periods, and security measures in place to safeguard my investment? I would also like to know the minimum requirements to participate in these programs and any associated fees. Break down the analysis for easy reading.

## 7\. Create a "Getting Started" Plan

Include essential resources, recommended online courses, best practices, and practical coding exercises to build a strong foundation in developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, include tips on debugging and common pitfalls to help me navigate the learning process smoothly.

![Screenshot of ChatGPT Role-play Vitalik Buterin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/role-play-anyone-for-their-crypto-opinion.jpg)

 Yes, you can have fun with ChatGPT too. This prompt exemplifies how you can turn ChatGPT into a crypto thought leader and get their opinion without DMing them on social media. You can even go further and generate a conversation with two personalities.

## ChatGPT Crypto Prompts Are Like Cheat Codes

 ChatGPT crypto prompts can be likened to cheat codes. They significantly reduce the time and effort you need to become informed. In this age, promptly getting the most important information is crucial. Hence, using the power of ChatGPT to make your crypto journey more enjoyable is a wise move.

 But please note that using ChatGPT for crypto analysis is just one part of the puzzle. You shouldn't rely on ChatGPT for analysis because of its limited dataset and its well-documented issues with hallucination. Furthermore, nothing replaces the research you should do before investing any money in crypto!
