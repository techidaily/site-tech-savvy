### Ridge Wallet

#### Best AirTag wallet overall

The Ridge wallet is a slim RFID-blocking wallet designed to hold up to 12 cards. Cash can be stored via a cash strap or money clip on the outside of the wallet, and the brand offers three AirTag configurations for tracking: an AirTag holder designed to  or  for $25, or the [AirTag carbon add-on holder](https://ridge.com/products/carbon-case-for-airtag) that attaches outside any Ridge wallet for $40\. 

The Ridge offers durability and functionality while also providing top-notch security and smart capabilities. Although it is a bit pricey, it has a lifetime warranty to keep up with your daily use and a risk-free 99-day trial period. All things considered, a quality, traditional leather-style wallet could easily run you over the $100 mark, too, which makes this long-term investment worth it, in my opinion. 

I gifted this wallet to my Dad a year before using one myself, and I can confidently say it's a winner. Prior to gifting him the Ridge, he used several other wallets, including a traditional leather and titanium case style, but none of them fit his needs. 

My Dad is a shove-everything-into-your-pockets-and-go kind of person, and no wallet could ever keep all his cards, cash, and receipts organized until the Ridge. The minimalist design helps ensure he can put what he really needs into his wallet and makes it easy to access cards and cash when he wants.

I initially thought the maneuvering to slide the cards in and out would be annoying, but after a little practice, he said it became second nature and is surprisingly easier than opening and removing cards or cash from a traditional wallet. I agree that there's a brief learning curve involved, but once you get it down, it's a non-issue. 

The practicality, coupled with the RFID technology, numerous color and metal options, and the addable AirTag tracker, makes the Ridge nearly faultless. Although it can get a little chunky when it's full to the brim with cards (but alas, what wallet doesn't?). This is a great wallet for small handbags, concert or stadium bags, and going out on the town, too. 

Current Ridge customers said on the website that they liked the wallet capacity, durability, design, and functionality of the Ridge wallet. The wallet features a 4.8/5 starts online, and 97% of customers said they'd recommend the Ridge wallet to a friend. Several customers said they were repeat purchasers, and that their wallets stood the test of time.

**Ridge Wallet specs: Type:** Expandable | **Material:** Aluminum **|** RFID blocking | Accessories and add ons available | Several materials and designs | Cash strap or money clip for cash storage | **Dimensions:** 86 x 54 x 6 mm

Pros 
* Stylish

* No AirTag necessary

Cons

### Journey LOC8 Tracking Wallet and Phone Stand

#### Best non-AirTag tracking wallet

If you're not dead set on using an AirTag wallet or [AirTag accessory](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airtag-accessories) to track your wallet, it may be worth it to consider a [MagSafe wallet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-wallets/) equipped with location tracking. The Journey LOC8 is the finder wallet version of our pick for best overall MagSafe wallet, the [Ezmo wallet](https://journeyofficial.com/products/ezmo-magsafe-wallet-phone-stand?) (pictured above). 

Journey's MagSafe wallet is the perfect balance of style and function with enough space to hold 5 cards. The wallet also doubles as a phone stand, so you can watch your favorite entertainment on the go or keep your phone screen visible at your desk. The stand has adjustable viewing angles in both portrait and landscape modes and features a protective lining to safeguard your cards' information with RFID-blocking technology while preventing your cards from becoming demagnetized.

The LOC8 takes all the great features of the Ezmo wallet one step further, offering location tracking -- no AirTag needed. It uses Apple's Find My technology for easy integration, is rechargeable, and comes with built-in speakers so you can easily ping the LOC8 wallet to find its location.

I tested the Ezmo version of the Journey wallet for several weeks during my commute from New Jersey to New York City, and I like it enough to recommend the LOC8 with built-in tracking confidently. I like the premium feel and how easy the wallet makes it to access my transit cards during my commute. I also like how the wallet provides enough space for 5 cards and folded cash. It's perfect for holding my debit card, work badge, and other incidentals like paper train tickets. The phone stand was nice, too. Although it's one of the pricier options for a MagSafe wallet, I think it's well worth the investment due to its multi-functionality and excellent quality, especially if you use your MagSafe wallet every day.

Current users on the Journey website said they liked the slim profile, smart design, larger card capacity, and sleek material -- so much so that the wallet has a 5/5 star rating online, with one customer noting that it "does it all really well." 

**Journey LOC8 tracking wallet and phone stand features:** **Type:** MagSafe bifold | Multi-functional | RFID protection | Built-in lock to prevent card slippage | Water resistant | Built-in speaker | Apple Find My System compatible | Rechargeable | **Dimensions:** 66 mm x 103 mm x 14 mm | **Card capacity:** Up to 5 cards

Pros 
* Cash strap
* Lightweight
* Dedicated AirTag slot
* Budget friendly

Cons 
* Limited colors
* Not scratch-resistant
* Cheap material

### Spigen AirTag Card Holder Wallet S

#### Best mid-range AirTag wallet

The Spigen AirTag Wallet S is a more affordable and expandable wallet design. Similar in overall construction and function the the Ridge wallet, the main difference is the material and price point. 

Despite its streamlined design, the Spigen AirTag Wallet S holds up to 12 cards. The polycarbonate shell makes for a super-light build, so it won't weigh your purse or pockets down. The nylon elastic cash strap is an extra bonus to stow away your bills. It also incorporates special RFID-blocking protection to prevent RFID card readers from stealing your information.

"The Spigen AirTag Wallet S's sleek design and compact form initially drew my attention," says Liz Ho, an experienced camping guide, travel expert, and founder of [Camping Guidance](https://campingguidance.com/). "Its built-in AirTag compartment gave me peace of mind, knowing I could easily locate my wallet if it ever went missing." 

Current Amazon customers said they liked that the Spigen S wallet was more affordable, had a dedicated, built-in spot for an AirTag, and held both cash and cards. However, some experienced damage early on and didn't like the plastic material. Overall, customers said they were happy with the appearance and value of the wallet but wished it had some improvements in material and performance.

**Spigen AirTag Wallet S specs: Type:** Expandable | RFID-blocking | Cash strap for cash storage | **Material:** Polycarbonate | Cash strap for cashe storage | **Dimensions:** 1.18 x 3.15 x 1.97 inches

### Ekster Wallet for AirTag

#### Best card slide AirTag wallet

The Ekster Wallet for AirTag combines minimalism with affordable luxury functions. It holds up to 12 cards as well as cash. Plus, it features RFID-blocking technology, a dedicated AirTag slot, quick access with a push button, and an easy slide-up function to fan out cards. 

It's an AirTag-compatible version of the brand's popular Parliament wallet, and it's slim enough to fit in your front or back pocket. However, it's slightly expensive and lacks color options. 

Current Ekster wallet users on the Ekster website said they liked the high-quality construction, overall design, and easy function. One customer said they even upgraded to this AirTag wallet after losing their Parliament wallet on vacation, and another called it perfect. "If you have been looking for a wallet that is high-quality with all the features, this is definitely the wallet for you," one customer wrote in their review. 

**Ekster Wallet for AirTag specs: Type:** Slide | **Material:** Leather | Slide-up function to fan cards | RFID-blocking | Minimalist design | AirTag slot | Quick card access with button | **Dimensions:** 4.1 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches

### Doeboe AirTag Bifold Wallet

#### Best budget AirTag wallet

The Doeboe AirTag Wallet is the best budget AirTag wallet with a surprisingly lightweight build despite its leather material. 

Ricky Allen, marketing director of [Ever Wallpaper](https://everwallpaper.com/), says, "It's a great wallet with all the necessities, like card slots, a pocket for bills, and an AirTag keychain holder."

Made of Crazy Horse leather, this bifold wallet features 10 different card slots, including a bill pocket to stash your cash. It also has an ID window so you don't have to take your driver's license out whenever you need to show it. The simple, minimalist design is simple to manage and also lightweight, so it won't weigh your pockets down.

Allen commented on the security as well. "I liked how easy it was to insert my AirTag and the anti-theft RFID protection it provides. Security is very important to me, and I'm glad this wallet provides the added protection of RFID-blocking."

Current Doeboe wallet users on Amazon said they liked the appearance, durability, and compactness of the wallet, with several customers emphasizing the genuine leather construction.

## Factors to consider when choosing an AirTag wallet

If you're in the market for an AirTag wallet, you already know the marketplace is copious. Here's a few things to keep in mind while you search that may help you narrow down your options and find the right fit for you. 

* **Capacity**: Consider what you want to store in your wallet. How many cards? Cash? Any other incidentals like your work badge or transit passes? We'd recommend finding out your absolute bare minimum need for card capacity (maybe that's three cards or maybe it's ten) and factoring that into your search. You'll easily be able to cut a huge chunk of options out based on capacity alone.
* **Security**: Many AirTag wallets provide RFID-blocking, which means that it blocks card scanners that can steal your information. If this is a top priority for you, you can drop many of the cheaper options, which often don't offer these capabilities.
* **Cost**: The price of AirTag wallets can vary considerably, and like with any purchase, establishing a budget is key. While we've included a budget, mid-range, and expensive pick on this list, you need to decide for yourself what your magic number is. Keep in mind that your wallet is often an everyday essential that lasts for a number of years, so it may be worth it to set a higher budget. Plus, many quality traditional leather wallets often cost over $100, too.
* **Your needs:** So you're here because you think you want an AirTag wallet. But maybe what you're actually looking for is a Bluetooth tracker card to upgrade your favorite traditional wallet. Or maybe you just want an AirTag card insert to do the same. Think about what you actually need right now and what makes the most sense for your lifestyle -- it may not be what you thought at first.

## What is an AirTag?

An AirTag is a type of tracking device. You can affix it to an object, and the AirTag will then provide tracking for that item. Simply log into the Find My app to track your device and see an exact location. You can also ping your phone so it sounds like an alert, helping you to find it that much easier. 

## Can AirTags be used in a wallet?

Yes, AirTags can be used to track anything like keys, bags, purses, wallets, and more. There's lots of [accessories on the market](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airtag-accessories/) to seamlessly configure an AirTag to your needs, and likewise, many AirTag wallets are specially designed to hold an AirTag to upgrade your traditional wallet with location-tracking capabilities. 

**Also:** [**The best AirTag accessories of 2024**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airtag-accessories/)

## Are AirTag wallets the only tracking options out there?

No, by no means are AirTag wallets the only [bluetooth tracking](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-bluetooth-tracker/) accessories on the market. You can equip and configure traditional wallets with tracking cards like the KeySmart Smart Card, or use other alternative trackers like Tile. And if you want to upgrade to a [MagSafe wallet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-wallets/), some are available with built-in tracking configurations already installed, like the [Journey LOC8 wallet](https://journeyofficial.com/products/loc8-finder-wallet-and-stand). 

**Also:** [**The best bluetooth trackers of 2024**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-bluetooth-tracker/)

## What types of bluetooth tracking is available for my wallet?

There's a few different types of products and configurations that will help you track your wallet, no matter where you leave it. Here are the most common: 

1. A wallet specially designed to house an AirTag tracker, either by design or with added attachments.
2. A Bluetooth tracker card that uses Apple's Find My technology that can slide into an existing wallet like any other card.
3. A tracker card designed to hold an AirTag that can slide into an existing wallet like a card.
4. Wallets that are already enabled with their own Bluetooth tracking systems and don't require an AirTag (these often use Apple's Find My technology).
5. MagSafe wallet options are enabled with Bluetooth tracking (which also likely uses Apple's Find My technology).

## Can I build my own custom AirTag?

While this may not be the conventional route, if you're interested in tinkering and building your own custom AirTag setup, you actually can. ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes did himself in April 2023, and wrote up his own [step-by-step guide](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-built-a-custom-airtag-that-apple-will-hate-me-for-and-how-you-can-do-it-too/) that you can follow.

## Do AirTags interfere with credit cards?

AirTags will not interfere with your debit or credit cards and they will not cause demagnetization. AirTags operate using Apple's Find My technology and a bluetooth connection, and the frequency does not disturb your cards.

## What does RFID mean?

According to the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/radio-frequency-identification-rfid-what-it), RFID refers to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. This technology uses radio waves to identify people or objects. 

There are devices that can read information contained in a wireless device or "tag" from a distance without making any physical contact or requiring a line of sight -- for example, the chips in credit or debit cards. Wallets which feature RFID-blocking technology prevent these devices from accessing information stored in protected chips, which can help prevent your bank information from being compromised.

## How far can I track my AirTag?

The beauty of an AirTag is that it can be tracked from anywhere. Your AirTag just needs to be within range of a Bluetooth connection while near an Apple device. It does not even have to be your own phone, so as long as you are close to an Apple device, you can use AirTag technology to locate your wallet.

## How can I find out if an AirTag is tracking me?

If you're an iPhone user, there's a few ways to recognize if an AirTag is tracking you. Your phone may alert you of an "AirTag found moving with you." This will happen if these things are true:

1. The AirTag is separated from its owner.
2. Your iPhone is awake.

## More AirTag wallets to consider   

If you haven't found an AirTag wallet that feels right for you, here are a [few alternatives](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-wallets/) that may better suit your needs -- it may not be a traditional wallet that you're looking for at all.
