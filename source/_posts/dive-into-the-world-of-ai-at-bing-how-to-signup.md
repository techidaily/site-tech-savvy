## Dive Into the World of AI at Bing: How-To Signup

 Bing brings much more to the browser table with the introduction of its AI-powered search engine, which turns search from one-way traffic to a two-way conversation between humans and AI.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 You can even customize your chats and search results to suit your personality. For instance, you can ask Prometheus (that's it's name) to be more creative, balanced, or precise with its results.

## Bing Adds AI Power to Search

 Microsoft's AI-powered Bing search engine looks [set to change search as we know it](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-bing-ai-powered-change-search-experience/). The jury's still out on whether it can [beat Google at search](https://www.makeuseof.com/bing-ai-powered-beat-google-search/), but things certainly look promising.

 As you no doubt already know, a typical Google search returns hundreds or millions of possible results. Prometheus, the new Bing AI-powered search engine, uses OpenAI's language model and works differently but similarly to ChatGPT.

 For every query you submit, it will scour the internet for relevant answers. But it doesn't stop there. The search engine will further summarize its findings into more straightforward and articulate responses that you can use immediately. Plus, it'll equally cite sources as references.

## How to Use Bing’s AI-Powered Search Engine

 At launch, you needed to join a waitlist in order to try Bing's AI-powered search engine, but it's now available for everyone. Here's how to use it:

1. Head over to [Bing](https://www.bing.com/new?form=MY029I&OCID=MY029I)'s dedicated page.
2. If you're using a non-Edge browser, you'll need to switch over to Edge.  
![Open in Microsoft Edge prompt on a white background](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/open-in-microsoft-edge.jpg)
3. Click on **Sign in** (in the top-right corner) to log in to your Microsoft Account.
4. Once inside, click on **Chat now**.
5. Pick a conversation style. By default, this is set to **More Balanced**. You can choose to be **More Precise** or **More Creative**.  
![New Bing Chat Interface showing Conversation Style options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/new-bing-chat-interface.jpg)
6. Go to the typing area and enter your question. You have a 2,000-character limit.
7. When done, click the send arrow and wait for it to populate your answer.
8. It will also preempt your next question or response by suggesting chat prompts.

 Bing also allows you to switch between just **Chat** and **Search** with chat. To experience the Bing AI-powered search:

1. Go to the top of the page and click on **Search**, next to **Chat**.
2. Clear the search box of any pre-filled query and enter yours. It'll return a search result box similar to [Google's Featured Snippets](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-google-featured-snippets/).  
![Bing AI-powered search showing results page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bing-ai-powered-search-results.jpg)
3. It'll also show you prompts that you can click on to learn more about your subject, including how to contact them (for most people searches).
4. You can further refine your search by typing a query into the chat box just beneath the main result (if available for your query). To your right, you'll find additional information, for some searches.
5. If you search for celebrities or popular personalities, it can pull up their Wikipedia entries as well as a chat option to help you learn more about their work, personalities, worldview, and so on. Again, this is subject to availability. To begin, simply click on **Let's chat**.  
![Bing AI-powered Search showing results page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/new-bing-search-with-ai.jpg)

 Chat mode will only be available when you have access to the AI-powered Bing.

## What to Expect from Bing’s AI-Powered Search Engine

 With Bing's AI-powered search, you can expect to enjoy a faster and richer search experience than you would get from a regular Google or Bing search. You can also expect to get citations or references as well as conversational chat results.

 In March 2023, Google also released the early version of Bard, its ChatGPT and Bing AI search competitor. Time will tell who does it better. At the end of the day, users will be the better for it, with a much more improved search experience either with Bing or Google.
