## Boost Your Creative Output: Using ChatGPT on a Mac

## How to Use ChatGPT via Your Mac's Browser

 OpenAI doesn't offer an official ChatGPT desktop app for macOS. Therefore, accessing ChatGPT through its website in your browser is still the best way to use ChatGPT on a Mac.

 Here's how to use the AI chatbot in your browser:

1. Open your preferred browser and type [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/) into the address bar. Then, hit the **Return** (or **Enter**) key.

2. Select **Log in** if you already have an account, and if you don't, choose **Sign up**.
3. Enter your email and password.
4. Alternatively, you can log in or sign up with a Google account by clicking **Continue with Google**. This method is faster and saves you from remembering passwords.

5. If you're on Safari, you can [sign up with your Apple account](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-sign-in-with-apple/) and Touch ID by clicking **Continue with Apple**. This option is ideal if you want to hide your email address from OpenAI.

 As soon as you're done, you can access ChatGPT and begin to type in your prompts. You can use your browser to access [ChatGPT alternatives](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternatives-chatgpt/) as well if you'd like to explore other chatbots.

 By default, you get GPT 3.5 for free. You have to [pay for ChatGPT Plus to access GPT 4](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt4/), a better and more creative version of GPT 3.5\.

## Other Ways to Access ChatGPT on a Mac

 While the browser is the most reliable way to access ChatGPT on a Mac, some other methods could shorten the steps you need to take to use it.

* You can add ChatGPT as a web app on your Dock. Open [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/) in Safari, click **File** on the menu bar, and choose **Add to Dock**. Click **Add** when you see the dialogue box.

* If you want to integrate the chatbot into your Mac so that you can use it without opening your browser, you can download [MacGPT](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/menugpt). It's a third-party app that can add dialogue windows for ChatGPT to your desktop and menu bar. But you have to pay $20 for it.

## Wait for an Official ChatGPT App for Your Mac

 Accessing ChatGPT through your Mac's browser is the safest option for now. If you don't mind paying for a third-party app, you can go ahead and get one of them, like MacGPT, for example. However, it's probably a good idea to wait and see if OpenAI releases a desktop app for macOS, although that seems unlikely.
