## Reimagining Do-It-Yourself with Upcoming AI

 Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, and OpenAI's GPT-4 is set to be the next big thing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The text generation language model’s current version, GPT-3.5, has surpassed people’s expectations with conversational capabilities ranging from chat companionship to code generation.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 It is public information that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is developing GPT-4, 3.5’s successor. Upcoming model details are undisclosed, but it's speculated to be a more robust and capable version.

 Cloud-based data analysis by GPT-4, integrated with microcontroller-based platforms like Arduino, will offer DIYers a more productive approach to product development.

## Multi-Modal AI and DIY: What Is a Multi-Modal AI?

### Advanced Language Processing Capabilities

 Large-scale language generation is a feature that will allow the generation of large, coherent, and accurate texts that provide informative responses to DIY enthusiasts. A multilingual support feature will also diversify the use of the language model by the DIY community, hence promoting collaboration and quickening the formation and implementation of ideas.

### AI-Based IDE Plugins

 The integration of AI tools and extensions in IDEs is already taking off with modules such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). GitHub Copilot is a tool from GitHub that is powered by [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/), a GPT3-based model.

 Such tools being available in development environments aid in the generation of flawless code, and speed up the process of writing code for complex DIY projects—not forgetting debugging features.
