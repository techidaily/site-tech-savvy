## Brainstorm Ideas

 The beginning of every poetry book needs one thing: poems. Many times, the poems can be based on one theme or showcase a storyline.

 To write poetry, though, you have to be in the right emotional headspace for it. If you’re not, it can be a bit difficult to scribe lines.

 ChatGPT can help with that. Brainstorming ideas can come in the nature of prompts, collaboration, and even sharing other poetry to inspire your thought process.

 If you’re curious about what topic your poetry should focus on, ask ChatGPT for a list of themes and pick which ones resonate with you.

![ChatGPT poetry prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-prompt.jpeg)

 You may already know what theme you’re going for. If so, you can ask for prompts about that theme or have ChatGPT ask you questions to help refine your ideas. The questions should be thought-provoking to help you infuse as much emotion into your work as you can. Remember, AI can’t feel, so it’s up to you to make your readers feel your art.

![ChatGPT new poetric approach prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-new-approach.jpeg)

 If you really want to test your poetic abilities, ask the AI to suggest a new poetic approach with steps to help guide you. Even if it doesn’t make it to a final draft, it’s still a good exercise to enhance your writing abilities.

## Help With Language and Style

 There are so many [creative ways that ChatGPT can be used](https://www.makeuseof.com/creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-openai/). Helping to build poems with fluid language and style is one of them.

 Having refined language and style in a poem helps to express your ideas and emotions to your readers. If it’s inconsistent and hard to understand, your readers won’t be able to keep up with the art you’re trying to create in your book.

![ChatGPT Poetic Device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-poetic-device.jpeg)

 Using poetic devices can help to make a good poem great. Ask ChatGPT for a poetic device that will fit within the poem structure you’re going for.

![ChatGPT poetry imagery word options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-imagery.jpeg)

 You can also ask ChatGPT for some good imagery words that align with the subject of your poem. For example, if you’re writing about the moon’s reflection on top of the water, but you’re having a hard time with wording, you can choose from a list offered by the AI.

## Offer Alternative Word Choices

 The thesaurus is every writer’s best friend when they can’t think of the right words to use. ChatGPT can be used to find alternative words and even offer words for a concept you’re thinking of.

![ChatGPT synonym options for stick](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-synonym.jpeg)

 For instance, if you have a line that you know will be about a dying leaf on a stick, but you don’t want to use the word "stick," ask ChatGPT for a more attractive synonym.

## Assist With Form and Structure

 Beyond the words, form and structure are some of the most important elements of a poem. They determine the type of poem it is and how the poem progresses to create an experience for the reader. In other words, the meter, stanza lengths, and rhyme schemes of a poem, just to name a few.

 If there’s a particular style of poem you’re looking to write, ChatGPT can give you the guidelines to create it. Additionally, you can ask about rhyme schemes for a poem with a certain amount of lines and choose from the options available.

 Frankly, any question you have regarding poetry can be asked and ChatGPT will be able to provide an answer with examples.

## Proofread and Edit

[Proofreading and editing are such helpful features within ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/), even with poetry. You can copy and paste your newly written poem and ask the AI to check for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and other oversights you may have missed.

![ChatGPT proofreading a poem with grammatical errors](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-proofreading.jpeg)

 In terms of editing, though, you’ll want to make sure that ChatGPT doesn’t change your poetry too much. You still want the work to be your own. Additionally, there’s a good chance that the emotions you’ve purposely embedded into the poems will be altered.

## Suggestions for Poem Arrangement

 In a poetry book, the arrangement of the poems is essential for creating a story—whether there’s a narrative or simply an emotional development. You’ll want your readers to follow along in the book and take something away from it.

 It would probably be a bit overwhelming to copy and paste every poem into the search bar and ask ChatGPT to arrange your work. However, you can let the AI know what kind of poems you have and ask for a list of ways to organize them.

![ChatGPT answer for how to arrange many poems in a book](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-poetry-book-arrangement.jpeg)

 In the end, it should be your decision what poem gets placed where.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Guidance With Publication

 The publication of a poetry book is a big step for a poet, and there are several questions to ask yourself. Should you consider a full-length poetry book or a chapbook? Are you going to self-publish or attempt to find a publisher?

 Though these questions will tend to be more of a personal choice, ChatGPT can help guide you with facts and research. Make sure you give enough information so the answer can be tailored to what you have created.

## Assist With Marketing and Promotion

 Although ChatGPT can’t promote your book for you, it can offer suggestions for how you can do it successfully. In the search bar, jot down all the information about your book and how to promote it, and see what it spits out for you. It could be anything from [creating an effective book ad](https://www.makeuseof.com/author-book-ad-ideas-to-build-brand/) to marketing yourself on social media.
