## Streamlined AI for Optimal Results with Bing, Android Edition

Bing AI Chat is a powerful combination of Microsoft's Bing search platform and OpenAI's language learning model. The intent is to optimize search results for relevance, speed, targeted results, and improved safety.It's integrated into Microsoft's Edge browser, available by accessing Bing's search web page, and even as an app for both Android and iOS. Bing AI isn't just great for search results, though. There are a ton of unique ways to use the technology, and some methods seem to function better on Android. Read on to learn more about using Bing AI Chat on Android.

## The Bing AI App for Android

![Bing logo with welcome text below](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/thenewbing.jpg)

 If you've already signed up to [try the AI-powered Bing search](http://www.makeuseof.com/try-bing-ai-powered-search-engine/), you can access it as both an integration in the Edge browser on the desktop and in the SwiftKey app on Android. However, it comes with some limitations in SwiftKey and the integrated and web page alternatives.

 Bing with AI for Android, as an app, on the other hand, actually has a few unique benefits. While it's primarily meant for accessing Microsoft's search engine, there's a large button at the bottom center of the app for accessing Bing AI. You can download it for free from the Play Store.

**Download:**[Bing](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2024360/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.bing) (Free)

 If you've already been using [SwiftKey's Bing Chat integration](https://www.makeuseof.com/bing-ai-chat-android-keyboard/) but want to expand on its capabilities, the Bing app is the way to go. After installing it, accessing and using the AI chat is easy:

1. Open the Bing app.
2. Sign in to your Microsoft account.
3. Tap the **Bing logo** at the bottom center of the screen.

 Once you've opened Bing AI chat, there are three primary styles, displayed as buttons, you can use. These are **Creative**, **Balanced**, and **Precise**.

![Bing app toggles for creative, balanced, and precise mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/three-styles-cropped.jpg)

 The creative style is perfect for storytelling and image generation. Balanced is excellent for getting general answers with some context from the web. And finally, the precise style is ideal for fact-checking and getting exact information.

 It's worth mentioning, though, that Bing AI chat is sometimes inaccurate and may make mistakes.

### Interacting With Bing AI

 Using Bing AI is similar to [how you use ChatGPT on mobile](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-android-and-ios/), as well as Google's Bard. It involves sending a prompt, in various formats, for the AI to generate a response. While there are a wide variety of types of prompts you can use, the most common involve questions and instructions for generating specific content.

 In most cases, Bing AI will provide you with links to its sources for information in its replies. These links appear underneath each response, and you can tap them to visit the source websites.

 On Android, you can use Bing's built-in voice-to-text feature to chat with the app by tapping on the microphone that appears in the prompt bar at the bottom. If it doesn't seem to work for you, consider using the voice-to-text feature built into Gboard.

### The 20 Prompt Limit

 You might notice that the responses from Bing AI come with a counter that goes up to 20\. This is the limit for the number of responses for a single conversation. Microsoft applied this rule because lengthy conversations would lead to serious malfunctions on the part of Bing AI. Many users noted that Bing would become "moody," and provide immature and inaccurate responses.

 There are a plethora of examples online from other users. In some cases, Bing AI would even claim that it's sentient and offended by the user.

 When you hit the limit, tap the **Broom** button to clear the chat and start a new one.

## Benefits of Using Bing AI on Android

 While Bing AI is available across multiple devices and integrated into some apps and programs, some features stand out more on mobile devices, especially Android.

### Faster Image Generation

 It might not match the quality of some other AI image-generation apps or websites, but Bing's AI can generate some decent images based on prompts. To generate images, you have to tap on **More Creative** under **Choose a conversation style**, and then ask Bing to draw something based on your prompt.

 I tested Bing's image generation and was quite happy with the results. [AI often adds extra limbs or fingers](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-image-generators-hands-issue/), but asking it to fix this usually works.

 It also seems that Bing AI image generation is faster on Android. I went ahead and tested the speed for [image generation with Bing AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-bing-image-creator-free/) in Microsoft Edge, the Bing search web page, and the Bing app for both Android and iOS.

 It seems that the output is much faster on Android, usually taking between 10 and 25 seconds, depending on the complexity of the prompt.

### Integrated Voice Search

 Integrated voice search is more of a convenience than an especially useful or exclusive feature. But, it avoids users having to take extra steps for voice typing. You can use voice search by tapping the microphone in the chat bar.

### Visual Search

 Bing, even without its AI component, has visual search. Bing AI is a lot smarter, leveraging artificial intelligence while scanning and searching with visual search. While you can use Bing's original visual search across multiple devices, you can only leverage the AI on Android and iOS.

### Location-Based Results

 On a slightly less exciting note, Bing AI on Android and iOS also provides location-based results. This is optional, and you are asked to opt in upon launching the Bing app for the first time.

 The combination of location-based results, artificial intelligence, and a powerful search engine make for a fantastic way to find and explore shops, restaurants, and other locations in your area with ease.

## Bing for Android: A Real Google Rival

 Bing's new AI chat feature is taking the search engine to new levels, making it a real competitor in the market. It runs well on all platforms and in all formats, but it seems to function best on Android. Integrated voice search, faster image generation, location-based results, and visual search all make it stand out.

 But, is Bing AI the best choice for users on Android? To find out, you might want to look into how it performs against Google Bard and ChatGPT in various tests!
