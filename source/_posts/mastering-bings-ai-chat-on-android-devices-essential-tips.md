## Mastering Bing's AI Chat on Android Devices: Essential Tips

 Microsoft seriously wants you to use its Bing AI chatbot. The company has integrated it into the Bing app, Skype, and now Microsoft SwiftKey for Android devices. But is it enough to make you switch from your favorite keyboard app, like Gboard?

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Let’s take a look at how you can use Bing's ChatGPT-enhanced chat tool on Android directly from within your keyboard.

## How to Set Up SwiftKey On Your Android Device

 To get started, install [Microsoft SwiftKey Beta](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2023897/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey.beta) from Google Play. Yes, it must be the Beta version. As of April 2023, Bing AI chat is only available in SwiftKey Beta.

 Next, open SwiftKey to set up the keyboard on your Android phone. Press **Enable SwiftKey > Select SwiftKey > Finish up**. Then, follow the on-screen instructions that appear.

 Do note that during setup, you will be asked to sign in to your Microsoft account. This is optional, but you do need to do it to access Bing Chat. And regardless, if you decide to use SwiftKey as your phone’s main keyboard, we highly encourage you to sign in.

 This is because [SwiftKey](https://support.swiftkey.com/hc/en-us/articles/201448432-What-is-the-Microsoft-SwiftKey-Account-#:~:text=Backup%20%26%20Sync%3A%20Your%20Microsoft%20SwiftKey,your%20personalized%20insights%20right%20back.) itself states that the keyboard’s learned language data (i.e., the unique way you write to friends and family) is backed up to your Microsoft account and can sync across your other devices. Your downloaded themes and stats (such as frequently used emojis and even the subjects you text about the most) are also backed up here.

## How to Access Bing AI From the Keyboard

 To access Bing AI, tap the Bing icon when your on-screen keyboard appears. The icon is on the top left of the keyboard next to the “GIF” icon.

![bing chat in swiftkey on android](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-in-swiftkey-on-android.jpg)

 Three sections will appear at the top of the keyboard:

* Search
* Tone
* Chat

 The Search section is exactly what it sounds like: Bing Search. The Tone changes the tone of your written message. We have an example of that below. But for now, we’re only interested in using Bing AI chat via SwiftKey, which you access via the Chat button. Let’s check out how smoothly that operates.

## Let’s Test Bing Chat in SwiftKey for Android

 If you want [the standard Bing AI chatbot experience to search](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-bing-ai-powered-change-search-experience/) for movie times or as a companion app for [playing your Dungeons & Dragons campaign online](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-dungeons-dragons-online/), access Bing AI chat via Chat. Then, choose the conversation style based on the kind of answer you want. You can either type your query or speak it by tapping the microphone icon.

 We asked the Bing AI chatbot to give us movie times near us, and it didn’t disappoint. Continue asking it questions or queries to get more information about the same subject. Or tap the “broom” icon to start a new conversation about something totally different.

## Bing AI Is Now Only One Tap Away Thanks to Microsoft SwiftKey

 Integrating Bing AI into SwiftKey itself may prove to be a stroke of genius on Microsoft’s part. Who actually thinks to open Bing when they have a question? Anyone?

 But with the Bing icon displayed in a subtle yet eye-catching manner, it’s a reminder that one tap is all it takes to use Bing AI to write an e-mail or answer a question immediately. Or simply to make you sound more energetic when you lack energy. It’s a small touch that could have big results in your day-to-day, so consider trying it out.
