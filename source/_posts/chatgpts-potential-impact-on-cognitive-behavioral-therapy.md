**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 ChatGPT is not just a chatbot; it's your potential digital therapy assistant. While it doesn't have a degree from an Ivy League school, it's available all day and night, and you can access it for free. Before you roll your eyes in doubt, give it a try for yourself. You might be surprised!

## ChatGPT and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

 What makes ChatGPT suitable for the purpose of engaging in CBT? Well, ChatGPT has been trained on a wealth of data, including findings from psychological research, making it capable of grasping context and engaging in meaningful rhetoric.

 CBT is a practical method of psychotherapy that focuses on solving everyday problems in your life, such as identifying and changing negative thought patterns. Because CBT often includes discussions and reflections with a therapist, ChatGPT is well suited to replicate the therapeutic process.

 You can already [use ChatGPT to improve your emotional intelligence](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-develop-emotional-intelligence/), so why not use it with a CBT focus? After all, CBT has emerged in the research as one of, if not the most, effective forms of psychotherapy.

## Steps to Use ChatGPT for CBT

 For a CBT Session You might want to take a few moments to create an environment where you won't be distracted and so that you can focus on the task at hand. Log into ChatGPT on your preferred device. I normally use my PC as I can type more quickly with a full-sized keyboard, but you can [use ChatGPT on Android and iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-android-and-ios/), as well.

 Another important step before you begin is to set an intention. What do you want to discuss—anxiety, stress, or something else entirely? Simply remind yourself that you are going to spend the next 20 minutes focusing on working through some important things.

 Once you're rolling, it'll be a give-and-take situation. You'll share a thought or feeling, and ChatGPT will reflect or provide an alternative viewpoint.

 For instance, you might say, "I feel super anxious when I'm getting ready to give presentations at work." To which ChatGPT might respond, "What specifically made you feel anxious?" Through these interactions, you'll drill down to the heart of an issue.

 As you go, make a habit of jotting down key insights, especially after each session. Did ChatGPT point out a recurring thought pattern you might be having? That's your cue.

 At the same time, if something feels off or not quite clicking, you can adjust your questions or simply tell ChatGPT in no uncertain terms that it needs to try a different approach or line of reasoning.

## Writing Effective Prompts for CBT Practice

 There are many [CBT apps that can help with mental health](https://word2md.com/%E2%80%A2%09https:/www.makeuseof.com/cbt-apps-improve-mental-health). However, when diving into CBT with ChatGPT, you need to train it using prompts to get actionable results.

 This is perhaps the most important step when using ChatGPT for any purpose because technology can only be as insightful as the instructions they're given.

 A good prompt is like giving your GPS coordinates. It leads to a focused, relevant, and in the case of psychotherapy, insightful conversations. Being vague is like telling your GPS, "Take me somewhere fun." You might end up at the world's largest potato museum when you hoped for the beach.

### Creating Effective Prompts for CBT With ChatGPT

 First and foremost, set ChatGPT up to be a CBT therapist. Consider the following example:

 "Imagine you are a world-renowned psychotherapist who uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to treat patients of all types. You are well-versed in the most efficient methods for helping people overcome personal struggles using CBT. You are an educator, scientist, and all-around warm-hearted person who understands how to help people. You have a sense of humor, a sharp wit, clarity in communication, and the ability to tell engaging stories and anecdotes to communicate the point you're trying to make. You also ask questions when uncertain so that you can deliver the best possible advice. You also want to help people discover for themselves the issues they are having, and empower them with practical advice on how to improve their own well-being."

 You can tweak the above in a way that works best for you.

 After you've prepared ChatGPT to act like a therapist, you can begin to engage. But you'll want to be specific. Instead of "I'm feeling bad," try "I recently started a new job, and I'm worried that I'm in over my head. I've started to think non-stop about whether I'll be successful even when I'm not at work. Reflecting on my situation, can you summarize a CBT approach to overcoming my anxiety?"

 With this kind of input, ChatGPT will be able to provide some useful information.

 And if the information is not specific enough, you can ask ChatGPT to get more specific.

## Precautions and Limitations of Using ChatGPT for CBT

 Keep in mind the following when using ChatGPT for CBT:

* Protect your privacy and avoid sharing overly personal information. You never know where your data will end up, even with the most trusted websites.
* ChatGPT offers general advice based on probabilities and might miss subtle cues that differentiate your situation from the general population. Take its advice with a grain of salt.
* Consider reaching out to a real professional for deep or complex issues since ChatGPT might lack clinical judgment and intuition.
