### Method 1: Unblock a website from the Restricted sites list

 Check your Google Chrome proxy settings first. The website you want to access may be added to the Restricted sites list. If this website is in the Restriction sites list, you can simply remove it to solve the problem.  
 If you can’t find the website in the Restricted sites list, try the next method.

 1) Launch Google Chrome, click the three dots button in the upper right corner, then click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5.10-2.jpg)

 2) Scroll down to the bottom and click**Advanced** .

 3) Under System, click**Open proxy settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/g2.jpg)

 4) In the Security tab, select**Restricted sites** then click**Sites** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/g.jpg)

 5) If the website you want to access is on the list, you can select it and click**Remove** . Then click**OK** to finish setting.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/g1.jpg)

 6) Restart Google Chrome to check whether the problem is solved or not.

### Method 2: Reset your Hosts file to unblock websites

 If the first method can’t help, you can take a look at your Hosts file. The Hosts file contains the mappings of IP addresses to hostnames. It’s located at C:WindowsSystem32driversetc. If this file is modified, you may have problems.

**Note** : Please ensure your Hosts file is not hidden. Go to Control Panel, set it to view by Large icons. Click**File Explorer Options** . Under the View tab, click**Show hidden files, folders, and drives** to make sure you can find hosts file.

 1) Right-click on the**hosts** and open it with Notepad. If you see the website which you want to access with the numerals 127.0.0.1, your hosts file may have been modified, so you can’t access the site.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gg.jpg)

 2) Select the entire line that contains the URL and delete it. Save the changes and close the Notepad.

 3) Restart Google Chrome to see whether it takes effect.

### Method 3: Use a VPN to unblock websites

 If the website fails to load on Google Chrome, it may be because it’s blocked in your country or authorities like schools or companies. To get around the block, use a VPN to hide your IP address, so your ISP can’t block the site for you.

 Some VPN services are free but, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. Free VPNs are never as good as paid ones; either they’re not as fast or reliable, or they can be forced to share your details with the authorities.

 **Our favorite VPN is [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s fast and cheap, and – most importantly – it will keep your IP address hidden. Here’s how to use NordVPN to hide your IP address:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN in your device.

 2) Run NordVPN and open it.

 3) Click **Quick Connect** .
