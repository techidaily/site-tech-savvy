### Key Takeaways

* Takeaway 1: AI's versatile nature allows it to impact various sectors and perform virtually any task, but unregulated development poses privacy and security risks.
* Takeaway 2: The opinions of tech leaders like Elon Musk on AI are constantly changing, but they recognize that AI will disrupt industries and should be regulated.
* Takeaway 3: Integrating AI into platforms like Meta and Google can improve targeting and generate ad creatives, but skeptics argue that these features primarily focus on collecting user information and commodifying data.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 The tech community is divided on the AI race. Supporters believe that AI’s rapid evolution will advance society, while skeptics think AI-powered robots will eventually replace the human workforce. Of course, some theories are outright ridiculous, so if you’re listening to anyone’s opinions, they better come from global tech leaders with first-hand insights.

 So, what do voices like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates have to say about AI?

## 1\. Sam Altman

 Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, plays an integral role in the AI race. ChatGPT’s massive success worldwide prompted rival tech companies to experiment with [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/), paving the way for other AI platforms.

 Altman says AI will continue impacting various sectors because of its versatile nature—it has limitless potential. Developers can train it to perform virtually any task. Although innovative, he also understands that unregulated AI developments present privacy and security risks. [Altman even urges lawmakers to control the use and distribution of AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-openai-ceo-calling-for-more-ai-regulation/).

## 2\. Elon Musk

![Elon Musk Talking and Discussing With Hand Movements](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/elon-musk-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: JD Lasica/[Wikimedia Common](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elon%5FMusk%5F%283017880307%29.jpg)

 Elon Musk is notorious for his constant flip-flopping. Musk changes his mind consistently, from retracting controversial comments to [overhauling the UI of X](https://www.makeuseof.com/changes-elon-musk-twitter/), formerly known as Twitter. As expected, his opinions on AI are also all over the place.

 A [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6325259104112) report in April 2023 shows Musk diving deep into the dangers and risks of modern AI models. He believes they should be regulated. Considering these statements, many found it surprising when he launched a [new AI company called xAI in July 2023](https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musks-ai-firm-xai-launches-website-2023-07-12/).

 Musk will continue exploring AI despite his flip-flops. While he often talks about [how AI spreads misinformation](https://www.makeuseof.com/generative-ai-becoming-tool-for-disinformation/), he knows it will disrupt various industries.

## 3\. Mark Zuckerberg

 Mark Zuckerberg is exploring ways to integrate AI into Meta platforms. He plans on introducing tools that target consumer demographics accurately, generate ad creatives, and simulate natural human conversations. We’ll likely see new features as [Meta advances its open-source LLM, Llama](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-llama-2-and-how-can-you-use-it/).

 Although disruptive, not everyone’s happy with these changes. Skeptics argue that these AI-driven features primarily focus on collecting user information and improving Meta’s ad business. They believe Meta will merely use AI to commodify data.

## 4\. Larry Page and Sergey Brin

![Sergey Brin Wearing Google Glasses and Larry Page Speaking](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/larry-page-and-sergey-brin-side-by-side-1.jpg)

Image Credits: [Marcin Mycielsk](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Larry%5FPage%5Fin%5Fthe%5FEuropean%5FParliament,%5F17.06.2009.jpg) i and [Thomas Hawk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/7050489913)/Wikimedia Commons

 Google’s spot as the number one search engine is at risk because of the AI race. The emergence of AI tools changes the way consumers access information online. A [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html) report even shows that Alphabet asked Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founders, to assess how Google Search can maintain its market share.

 Page feels positive about AI integration. He mentioned in 2002 that [Google will only fulfill its mission once it becomes “AI-complete,”](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/google-speaks-secrets/9780470398548/9780470398548%5Fartificial%5Fintelligence.html) and the resources to achieve it are now accessible. The biggest roadblock to his goal is the tight competition. With thousands of tech companies exploring AI models, there’s no saying who’ll develop [artificial general intelligence (AGI)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-how-it-differs-generative-ai/) first.

 Brin is a bit more cautious about AI. He commonly talks about the security risks that come with the emergence of AI-driven platforms, especially with the lack of regulation. That said, he also understands that AI will shape the future. Both Brin and Page are collaborating with Alphabet to develop a general-purpose AI model for Google.

## 5\. Sundar Pichai

![Sundar Pichai Speaking in Documentary from Singapore Fintech Festival](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sundar-pichai-speaking-in-documentary.jpg)

 Alphabet Group CEO Sundar Pichai strongly believes in AI’s potential. In an interview with [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/google-ceo-ai-impact-to-be-more-profound-than-discovery-of-fire-electricity/) in April 2023, he even mentioned that AI rivals fire and electricity as humanity’s greatest discovery. It will supposedly change the way society functions.

 And even more interesting is that Pichai has been comparing AI with fire and electricity before the AI race started. A [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/01/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-is-more-important-than-fire-electricity.html) report shows that he already said the same in 2018\.

## 6\. Bill Gates

![Bill Gates Speaking at Tech Event While Seated and Smiling](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bill-gates-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: Kuhlmann /MSC/[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bill%5FGates%5FMSC%5F2017.jpg)

 Bill Gates feels optimistic about AI. Unlike other global tech leaders, he isn’t as concerned with the security and privacy risks that come with it. He outlines in [GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-risks-of-AI-are-real-but-manageable) that the dangers are real but manageable. As such, tech companies and developers shouldn’t let these issues prevent them from advancing AI systems.

 Gates also believes that AI will solve its issues. Developers would eventually develop AI-driven platforms that filter AI content, trace cybercriminals, and bolster cybersecurity systems.

## 7\. Jeff Bezos

![Jeff Bezos on Dark Stage With Dim Lighting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jeff-bezos-on-dark-background.jpg)

Image Credit: Daniel Oberhaus/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/163370954@N08/32878819397)

 Jeff Bezos has always disputed [AI myths](https://www.makeuseof.com/myths-artificial-intelligence-arent-true/). In this 2018 [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/11/jeff-bezos-on-ai-robots-wont-take-all-our-jobs.html) article, Bezos shares that [AI anxiety](https://www.makeuseof.com/resist-ai-anxiety-following-fast-developing-technology/) typically involves exaggerated misconceptions. He doesn’t believe AI can take our jobs or end humanity. On the contrary, technology will bring more job opportunities as sectors and consumer needs evolve.

 Bezos retained his optimistic stance on AI integration. He’s exploring ways to create a more futuristic, convenient shopping experience and retail industry through sophisticated models. Amazon will likely introduce more AI-driven features soon.

## 8\. Tim Cook

![Tim Cook Apple CEO Under Lights on Stage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tim-cook-under-ring-of-lights.jpg)

Image Credit: Mark Mathosian/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/markgregory/37404092154)

 Tim Cook is very receptive to AI advancements. He started analyzing ChatGPT and how Apple can utilize similar language models when OpenAI launched it in November 2022\. After all, Apple has been using AI algorithms for years now. It might lose its massive market share if rival brands explore newer models first.

 Cook also believes that no single institution can control AI. He shares with [Good Morning America](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/tim-cook-talks-new-apple-products-concerns-ai-99862624) that AI monitoring is necessary but challenging—tech companies must regulate themselves instead.

## 9\. Greg Peters

Image Credit: [Netflix](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/co-ceo-greg-peters-keynote-address-to-the-2023-mobile-world-congress)

 Generative AI is slowly affecting the entertainment industry. Hollywood professionals fear sophisticated models might put writers, visual effects specialists, and artists out of work. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/05/how-ai-took-center-stage-in-the-hollywood-writers-strike.html) reports that most streaming platforms aren’t cash flow positive—they’ll likely minimize their overhead by replacing some of their workers with AI tools.

 Take Greg Peters, the CEO of Netflix, for example. [Netflix generates billions in revenue every quarter](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273883/netflixs-quarterly-revenue/), yet Peters still believes AI will make the production process even more cost-efficient. You can expect executives from less-popular entertainment companies to share the same stance.

## 10\. Larry Ellison

![Larry Ellison Speaking on Stage at Event With Microphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/larry-ellison-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: Oracle PR/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/oracle%5Fimages/5016418080)

 Larry Ellison, the founder and chief technology officer of Oracle, saw his fortune skyrocket thanks to the AI race. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269722/oracle-revenue-since-2005/) reports that Oracle made nearly $50 billion for the fiscal year 2023\. The company successfully capitalized on the sudden increase in demand for AI licensing and cloud platforms.

 Ellison plans on elevating Oracle’s cloud services by partnering with Cohere. It’s a tech startup that develops LLMs. A [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-chooses-cohere-ai-startup-best-alternative-openai-2023-6) report says Oracle might offer generative AI products if this collaboration goes well.

## How Tech Leaders Feel About the AI Race

 AI’s rapid evolution makes it unpredictable. Even tech leaders who play active roles in developing this technology can’t foresee emerging applications, challenges, and breakthroughs. Again, AI’s autonomous nature allows it to evolve by itself. If trainers feed AI systems enough datasets, they’ll continue learning and improving.

 There’s no doubt, however, that AI systems will keep disrupting various sectors. Knowing how to integrate them into your daily workflow and supplement your skills gives you an edge. AI won’t replace humans, but humans using AI will outperform those who can’t.

It’s a tech startup that develops LLMs. A [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-chooses-cohere-ai-startup-best-alternative-openai-2023-6) report says Oracle might offer generative AI products if this collaboration goes well.

## How Tech Leaders Feel About the AI Race

 AI’s rapid evolution makes it unpredictable. Even tech leaders who play active roles in developing this technology can’t foresee emerging applications, challenges, and breakthroughs. Again, AI’s autonomous nature allows it to evolve by itself. If trainers feed AI systems enough datasets, they’ll continue learning and improving.

 There’s no doubt, however, that AI systems will keep disrupting various sectors. Knowing how to integrate them into your daily workflow and supplement your skills gives you an edge. AI won’t replace humans, but humans using AI will outperform those who can’t.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 The tech community is divided on the AI race. Supporters believe that AI’s rapid evolution will advance society, while skeptics think AI-powered robots will eventually replace the human workforce. Of course, some theories are outright ridiculous, so if you’re listening to anyone’s opinions, they better come from global tech leaders with first-hand insights.

 So, what do voices like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates have to say about AI?

## 1\. Sam Altman

Image Credit: TechCrunch/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techcrunch/14092193106)

 Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, plays an integral role in the AI race. ChatGPT’s massive success worldwide prompted rival tech companies to experiment with [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/), paving the way for other AI platforms.

 Altman says AI will continue impacting various sectors because of its versatile nature—it has limitless potential. Developers can train it to perform virtually any task. Although innovative, he also understands that unregulated AI developments present privacy and security risks. [Altman even urges lawmakers to control the use and distribution of AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-openai-ceo-calling-for-more-ai-regulation/).

## 2\. Elon Musk

![Elon Musk Talking and Discussing With Hand Movements](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/elon-musk-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: JD Lasica/[Wikimedia Common](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elon%5FMusk%5F%283017880307%29.jpg)

 Elon Musk is notorious for his constant flip-flopping. Musk changes his mind consistently, from retracting controversial comments to [overhauling the UI of X](https://www.makeuseof.com/changes-elon-musk-twitter/), formerly known as Twitter. As expected, his opinions on AI are also all over the place.

 A [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6325259104112) report in April 2023 shows Musk diving deep into the dangers and risks of modern AI models. He believes they should be regulated. Considering these statements, many found it surprising when he launched a [new AI company called xAI in July 2023](https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musks-ai-firm-xai-launches-website-2023-07-12/).

 Musk will continue exploring AI despite his flip-flops. While he often talks about [how AI spreads misinformation](https://www.makeuseof.com/generative-ai-becoming-tool-for-disinformation/), he knows it will disrupt various industries.

## 3\. Mark Zuckerberg

![Mark Zuckerberg Talking at a Facebook Event](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mark-zuckerberg-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: Anthony Quintano/[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mark%5FZuckerberg%5FF8%5F2019%5FKeynote%5F%2846985052514%29.jpg)

 Mark Zuckerberg is exploring ways to integrate AI into Meta platforms. He plans on introducing tools that target consumer demographics accurately, generate ad creatives, and simulate natural human conversations. We’ll likely see new features as [Meta advances its open-source LLM, Llama](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-llama-2-and-how-can-you-use-it/).

 Although disruptive, not everyone’s happy with these changes. Skeptics argue that these AI-driven features primarily focus on collecting user information and improving Meta’s ad business. They believe Meta will merely use AI to commodify data.

## 4\. Larry Page and Sergey Brin

![Sergey Brin Wearing Google Glasses and Larry Page Speaking](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/larry-page-and-sergey-brin-side-by-side-1.jpg)

 Google’s spot as the number one search engine is at risk because of the AI race. The emergence of AI tools changes the way consumers access information online. A [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html) report even shows that Alphabet asked Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founders, to assess how Google Search can maintain its market share.

 Page feels positive about AI integration. He mentioned in 2002 that [Google will only fulfill its mission once it becomes “AI-complete,”](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/google-speaks-secrets/9780470398548/9780470398548%5Fartificial%5Fintelligence.html) and the resources to achieve it are now accessible. The biggest roadblock to his goal is the tight competition. With thousands of tech companies exploring AI models, there’s no saying who’ll develop [artificial general intelligence (AGI)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-how-it-differs-generative-ai/) first.

 Brin is a bit more cautious about AI. He commonly talks about the security risks that come with the emergence of AI-driven platforms, especially with the lack of regulation. That said, he also understands that AI will shape the future. Both Brin and Page are collaborating with Alphabet to develop a general-purpose AI model for Google.

## 5\. Sundar Pichai

![Sundar Pichai Speaking in Documentary from Singapore Fintech Festival](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sundar-pichai-speaking-in-documentary.jpg)

Image Credit: Eesan1969/[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sundar%5FPichai,%5FCEO,%5FGoogle%5Fand%5FAlphabet%5FAt%5FSingapore%5FFinTech%5FFestival.png)

 Alphabet Group CEO Sundar Pichai strongly believes in AI’s potential. In an interview with [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/google-ceo-ai-impact-to-be-more-profound-than-discovery-of-fire-electricity/) in April 2023, he even mentioned that AI rivals fire and electricity as humanity’s greatest discovery. It will supposedly change the way society functions.

 And even more interesting is that Pichai has been comparing AI with fire and electricity before the AI race started. A [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/01/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-is-more-important-than-fire-electricity.html) report shows that he already said the same in 2018\.

## 6\. Bill Gates

![Bill Gates Speaking at Tech Event While Seated and Smiling](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bill-gates-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: Kuhlmann /MSC/[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bill%5FGates%5FMSC%5F2017.jpg)

 Bill Gates feels optimistic about AI. Unlike other global tech leaders, he isn’t as concerned with the security and privacy risks that come with it. He outlines in [GatesNotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-risks-of-AI-are-real-but-manageable) that the dangers are real but manageable. As such, tech companies and developers shouldn’t let these issues prevent them from advancing AI systems.

 Gates also believes that AI will solve its issues. Developers would eventually develop AI-driven platforms that filter AI content, trace cybercriminals, and bolster cybersecurity systems.

## 7\. Jeff Bezos

![Jeff Bezos on Dark Stage With Dim Lighting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jeff-bezos-on-dark-background.jpg)

Image Credit: Daniel Oberhaus/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/163370954@N08/32878819397)

 Jeff Bezos has always disputed [AI myths](https://www.makeuseof.com/myths-artificial-intelligence-arent-true/). In this 2018 [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/11/jeff-bezos-on-ai-robots-wont-take-all-our-jobs.html) article, Bezos shares that [AI anxiety](https://www.makeuseof.com/resist-ai-anxiety-following-fast-developing-technology/) typically involves exaggerated misconceptions. He doesn’t believe AI can take our jobs or end humanity. On the contrary, technology will bring more job opportunities as sectors and consumer needs evolve.

 Bezos retained his optimistic stance on AI integration. He’s exploring ways to create a more futuristic, convenient shopping experience and retail industry through sophisticated models. Amazon will likely introduce more AI-driven features soon.

## 8\. Tim Cook

![Tim Cook Apple CEO Under Lights on Stage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tim-cook-under-ring-of-lights.jpg)

Image Credit: Mark Mathosian/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/markgregory/37404092154)

 Tim Cook is very receptive to AI advancements. He started analyzing ChatGPT and how Apple can utilize similar language models when OpenAI launched it in November 2022\. After all, Apple has been using AI algorithms for years now. It might lose its massive market share if rival brands explore newer models first.

 Cook also believes that no single institution can control AI. He shares with [Good Morning America](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/tim-cook-talks-new-apple-products-concerns-ai-99862624) that AI monitoring is necessary but challenging—tech companies must regulate themselves instead.

## 9\. Greg Peters

![Greg Peters CEO Speaking on Stage at Netflix Event](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/greg-peters-speaking-on-stage.jpg)

Image Credit: [Netflix](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/co-ceo-greg-peters-keynote-address-to-the-2023-mobile-world-congress)

 Generative AI is slowly affecting the entertainment industry. Hollywood professionals fear sophisticated models might put writers, visual effects specialists, and artists out of work. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/05/how-ai-took-center-stage-in-the-hollywood-writers-strike.html) reports that most streaming platforms aren’t cash flow positive—they’ll likely minimize their overhead by replacing some of their workers with AI tools.

 Take Greg Peters, the CEO of Netflix, for example. [Netflix generates billions in revenue every quarter](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273883/netflixs-quarterly-revenue/), yet Peters still believes AI will make the production process even more cost-efficient. You can expect executives from less-popular entertainment companies to share the same stance.

## 10\. Larry Ellison

![Larry Ellison Speaking on Stage at Event With Microphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/larry-ellison-speaking-at-event.jpg)

Image Credit: Oracle PR/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/oracle%5Fimages/5016418080)

 Larry Ellison, the founder and chief technology officer of Oracle, saw his fortune skyrocket thanks to the AI race. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269722/oracle-revenue-since-2005/) reports that Oracle made nearly $50 billion for the fiscal year 2023\. The company successfully capitalized on the sudden increase in demand for AI licensing and cloud platforms.

 Ellison plans on elevating Oracle’s cloud services by partnering with Cohere. It’s a tech startup that develops LLMs. A [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-chooses-cohere-ai-startup-best-alternative-openai-2023-6) report says Oracle might offer generative AI products if this collaboration goes well.
