 There are dozens of AI chatbots and language models out there. Some excel at creative tasks, while others are better at reasoning. But what if you could access them all in one place?

## What Is Poe?

![poe homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poe-ain-page.jpg)

 Poe, an acronym for "Platform for Open Exploration," allows you to access various AI chatbots and language models, all from a single platform. As Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo noted on the [official Quora blog](https://quorablog.quora.com/Poe-1), Poe focuses on providing an easy-to-use interface for people to access language models rather than training or fine-tuning LLMs.

 Currently, you can use models like GPT 3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Claude-Instant, Claude 2, Google PaLM, Llama, etc. Besides these, Poe users have created hundreds of chatbots (using GPT, Claude, and Llama) that you can try.

## How to Use Quora's Poe

 Available on mobile, web, and macOS, you can create your account on [Poe](https://poe.com/) to start chatting with different bots right away.

 Poe's Assistant chatbot is selected by default on the homepage, so you can enter your prompt to start chatting with it. To access other chatbots, go to the Explore page and select the bot you want to talk with. All your previous chats are shown in the sidebar, so if you want to switch to a chatbot you've already used, you can simply open it from there.

 Though it works like any other chatbot, Poe stands out by offering prompt suggestions, voice messages, and support for PDFs (even on free accounts).

![poe assistant screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poe-assistant-screenshot.jpg)

 Most bots on Poe are free to use, but access to chatbots based on certain language models is limited for non-subscribers. For instance, free users can send a maximum of five messages to Claude 2-powered bots, 30 to Claude-instant ones, and 100 to StableDiffusion-based chatbots. Unfortunately, access to GPT-4 or ChatGPT-16K is unavailable without a subscription. For all other models and bots, the daily message limit is 100\.

 A Poe subscription costs $19.99 per month and increases the daily message limit. Though it doesn't share the exact limit on its subscription page, Poe promises at least 600 GPT-4 and 1,000 Claude 2 messages monthly at normal speeds. Beyond this, the availability will vary depending on user capacity.

## Which Chatbots Are Available on Poe?

 First, you can use language models like GPT 3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2, etc. on Poe. Then, there are a few official chatbots, like Web Search and Assistant, created by Poe. Moreover, you can use [Stable Diffusion XL to generate AI images](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-stable-diffusion-mac/) within Poe.

 However, this is only the tip of the iceberg. From the **Explore** page, you can find hundreds of user-created chatbots. These are categorized into image generation, role play, learning, games, programming, funny, professional, and more.

![poe explore bots](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poe-explore-bots.jpg)

 Here are a few examples of interesting chatbots you can find on Poe.

* **MS Office Presentation**: Though you can [create a presentation using ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-to-create-presentation/), Poe makes generating the text for your slides much easier.
* **DuolingoDupe**: As the name suggests, this bot helps you learn new languages.
* **ExcelFormulaPro**: This chatbot generates Excel formulas for any task you want to perform.

 As said, this is the tip of Poe's AI chatbot iceberg. There are an almost unfathomable number of options to choose from.

## How to Create AI Chatbots Using Poe

 Poe makes it quite easy for you to [create your custom AI chatbot](https://www.makeuseof.com/build-custom-chatgpt-with-your-own-data/). For this, it offers two options: prompt bots and server bots.

 Prompt bots are based on popular LLMs and require you to set a prompt instructing the bot how to respond. However, server bots require you to first build a bot in Python and then integrate it with Poe.

 To create a Poe prompt bot, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Create bot** in the sidebar.
2. Here, set a picture and unique handle for your chatbot.  
![poe create bot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poe-create-bot.jpg)
3. Select the Base bot. This Base bot is the LLM that your bot will be powered by. Currently, you can select different versions of GPT, Claude, Llama, and Stable Diffusion.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Now comes the main step: setting the prompt. Here, you have to instruct your bot on how to respond to questions. Think of it as [custom instructions in ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-custom-instructions-feature/).
5. Next, set a greeting message to be sent at the start of every chat.
6. Click **Advanced** to turn on/off prompt suggestions, enable markdown support, and set the temperature. The higher the temperature you set, the more creative and varied responses your chatbot will provide.
7. Lastly, you can set a bio for your bot and choose whether to make it publicly accessible.

 The other way to create your bot is to build a bot server in Python, make your bot server available on a publicly available URL, and paste that URL into the **Server URL field** while creating the bot. The [Poe Server Bot instructions](http://developer.poe.com/server-bots/quick-start) have detailed guidance on the process.

 Best of all, Poe has a monetization program that allows US-based creators to earn a commission when their AI bots make users subscribe to Poe. Poe also plans to introduce a per-message payment system. So, the more messages users send to your chatbot, the more you earn.

## Poe Grants Access to Multiple AI Chatbots in One Place

 With new language models and chatbots introduced constantly, having a single platform like Poe to access them all truly is a blessing. Not only does Poe save you the hassle of switching between AI chatbot apps, but it also provides a clean, easy-to-use interface.

 Best of all, you can use Poe to access hundreds of unique, user-created chatbots, build your own AI bot, and earn a few bucks from them.

* **MS Office Presentation**: Though you can [create a presentation using ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-to-create-presentation/), Poe makes generating the text for your slides much easier.
* **DuolingoDupe**: As the name suggests, this bot helps you learn new languages.
* **ExcelFormulaPro**: This chatbot generates Excel formulas for any task you want to perform.

 As said, this is the tip of Poe's AI chatbot iceberg. There are an almost unfathomable number of options to choose from.

## How to Create AI Chatbots Using Poe

 Poe makes it quite easy for you to [create your custom AI chatbot](https://www.makeuseof.com/build-custom-chatgpt-with-your-own-data/). For this, it offers two options: prompt bots and server bots.

 Prompt bots are based on popular LLMs and require you to set a prompt instructing the bot how to respond. However, server bots require you to first build a bot in Python and then integrate it with Poe.

 To create a Poe prompt bot, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Create bot** in the sidebar.
2. Here, set a picture and unique handle for your chatbot.  
![poe create bot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poe-create-bot.jpg)
3. Select the Base bot. This Base bot is the LLM that your bot will be powered by. Currently, you can select different versions of GPT, Claude, Llama, and Stable Diffusion.

4. Now comes the main step: setting the prompt. Here, you have to instruct your bot on how to respond to questions. Think of it as [custom instructions in ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-custom-instructions-feature/).
5. Next, set a greeting message to be sent at the start of every chat.
6. Click **Advanced** to turn on/off prompt suggestions, enable markdown support, and set the temperature. The higher the temperature you set, the more creative and varied responses your chatbot will provide.
7. Lastly, you can set a bio for your bot and choose whether to make it publicly accessible.

 The other way to create your bot is to build a bot server in Python, make your bot server available on a publicly available URL, and paste that URL into the **Server URL field** while creating the bot. The [Poe Server Bot instructions](http://developer.poe.com/server-bots/quick-start) have detailed guidance on the process.

 Best of all, Poe has a monetization program that allows US-based creators to earn a commission when their AI bots make users subscribe to Poe. Poe also plans to introduce a per-message payment system. So, the more messages users send to your chatbot, the more you earn.
