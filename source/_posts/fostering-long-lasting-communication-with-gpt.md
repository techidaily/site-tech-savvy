## Fostering Long-Lasting Communication with GPT

 There are so many things you can do with the powerful ChatGPT. You can write a cover letter, explain a complex topic, or prepare for an interview, among other options. Depending on the topic, you might want to re-read the conversation, so it's useful that ChatGPT saves and stores the previous conversations for you.

 But if ChatGPT isn't saving the chat history, you'll have to repeat some of your prompts all over again. So, how do you fix ChaGPT when it won't save your conversations?

## 1\. Turn On the Chat History & Training Data

 ChatGPT will save your previous conversations by default, so you can access them anytime. Now, if you or someone else accidentally disabled the feature, ChatGPT will no longer save any new conversations and delete the chat history.

 To avoid this from happening again, you should turn on the **Chat history & training** feature.

 Head to ChatGPT and click the **three-dot** icon next to your username, followed by **Settings** **\>** **Data controls**. Hit the toggle next to **Chat history & training** so that ChatGPT will save your conversations.

 You should know that this setting doesn't sync across multiple devices or browsers. So if you use ChatGPT on more than one browser or device, you'll have to enable the feature for each one.

## 2\. Check Your Network Connection

 There's a chance you can't access older ChatGPT conversations due to a faulty internet connection. So, check if your device is connected to the internet or try restarting your router.

 If you still can't figure out what's wrong with your internet connection, check out [how to fix your internet connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-internet-connection/).

## 3\. Delete Browser Cache

 When dealing with a website malfunction, you should try [deleting the browser cache and cookies](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/). This works well because it stops your computer from using old forms, which may not be removed even if you update your browser.

 After you've deleted the browser cache, you might notice websites loading a bit slower. This is because your browser is rebuilding the cache, which shouldn't take long.

## 4\. Use a Different Browser

 ChatGPT's inability to save your conversation might be limited to your browser. To test it, switch to another browser. If ChatGPT is working as usual, you'll have to fix your default browser.

 Try to launch ChatGPT in Incognito or Private Mode to figure out if one of the browser extensions is causing the issue. Also, you might be dealing with improper site settings. In this case, you should reset your browser to its default settings.

## 5\. Access ChatGPT Through a Shared Link

 This method only works for [ChatGPT conversations you've shared with other people](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/). Even if you've disabled the ChatGPT history feature, ChatGPT will store the conversation for 30 days before deleting it permanently.

 So, if you can access it, you should continue the conversation, as ChatGPT will now save it for future reference.
