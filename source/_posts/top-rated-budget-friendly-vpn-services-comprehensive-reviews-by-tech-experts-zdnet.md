## Top-Rated Budget-Friendly VPN Services : Comprehensive Reviews by Tech Experts | ZDNet

You may be concerned about your online security, but dread adding yet another substantial fee to your monthly budget by signing up for a [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/). 

Sure, there are [free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/), but they often come with speed and bandwidth limitations. It can also be unclear how some free VPN vendors make their money and whether your data is being mined, which negates the whole purpose of using a VPN to improve your privacy.

**Also:** [**The best VPN services: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/)

If you want the best protection, consider choosing an option from our tested list of the [best VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/). There are also cheap VPN providers that can do the job for as little as a few bucks per month while keeping your data safe and without requiring you to agree to shady data-sharing policies. These vendors already provide affordable services, but on occasion, they will also offer deals to compete in the saturated VPN market.

Our pick for the best cheap VPN overall is [Ivacy](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=42897&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ivacy.com%2Fbuy-vpn%2F), a stable and low-cost VPN with long-term plans for only $1.17 per month. It doesn't offer the best mobile app functionality or speed, but this VPN is still worth considering for the price.

### Ivacy

#### Best cheap VPN overall

Ivacy is the VPN for you if you want a set-and-forget VPN that will last for years -- and at a very cheap price.

Ivacy has over 6,500 servers across over 100 locations, a zero-logs policy, split tunneling, and utilizes the WireGuard protocol. It does, however, limit you to 10 simultaneous device connections. 

**Also:** [**The best VPNs for iPhone and iPad**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/)

Ivacy is compatible with many devices and operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Kodi, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Some user reviews indicate that this VPN is a great option for torrenting, but during testing, we found that speeds were slow.

At the moment, Ivacy has a deal running for five-year plans. If you're willing to sign up, you will pay the equivalent of only $1.17 per month. The company has also included optimized streaming support. You'll need to pay extra for a dedicated IP or other advanced features, though. 

A two-year subscription costs $1.99 per month, or you could pay $10.45 for one month of access. Customers applaud the firm's support team, although some users would like to see improvements to Ivacy's apps. 

**Ivacy features**: **Money-back guarantee:** 31 days | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Kodi, and more | **Simultaneous connections:** 10 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Logging:** Payment information only | **Countries:** 70+ | **Servers**: 6,500+ | **Trial**: One week for $0.99

### Surfshark VPN

#### Best cheap VPN runner-up

In our [Surfshark review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/) and tests, we found this VPN performs well as a top-quality (but still cheap) VPN that is worth considering if you are willing to pay a little more every month. 

Surfshark offers unlimited connections, a strong server network, WireGuard compatibility, and solid performance. We've found it to be quick to connect and stable, although sometimes, speed is only in the mid-range of what other providers offer.

Despite this, Surfshark has earned a strong user base over the years and is known as a trustworthy VPN with consistently low pricing.

The cheapest option, a two-year subscription called Surfshark Starter, costs $1.69 per month. Three months of free access are included. This deal is worth considering, as typically, even at a "deal" rate, you will pay at least $2 per month.

Alternatively, you can sign up for a yearly subscription at $2.39 per month or pay $12.29 for one month of access.

Customers appreciate Surfshark's consistently cheap pricing and quick, efficient customer service.

**Surfshark VPN f** **eatures:** ****Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited | **Kill Switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Firefox, nd Android TV | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries**: 100 | **Servers**: 3,200+ | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: seven days on Android, iOS, and macOS

### PrivadoVPN

#### Best cheap VPN with a free option

PrivadoVPN is another choice if you are looking for a cheap or free plan. This Swiss VPN offers a comprehensive free option with support for up to 10 devices -- but you are limited to 10GB of monthly traffic.

The user interface is clean and easy to use, and there is a handy button for enabling the kill switch -- which protects your traffic if your internet connection drops without warning. Unfortunately, PrivadoVPN lacks some of the advanced features offered by VPN competitors. There also appears to be little evidence of third-party auditing.

Prices begin at $1.99 per month for two years of access (with three months free) and $2.99 per month for an annual plan (including three months free), rising to $10.99 if you want to try out the software for a single month. Customers like it as a set-and-forget VPN, although some have reported technical issues.

**PrivadoVPN features:** **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, and more| **Simultaneous connections:** Unlimited, 10 on a free plan | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Logging:** no-logs policy,credit card not required for a free plan | **Countries:** 49 (13 on the free plan) | **Servers**: 200+| **Trial**: Free plan with a 10GB limit

### Private Internet Access

#### Best open source cheap VPN

Private Internet Access (PIA) is a reliable, open-source VPN that is perfect for beginners because it's user-friendly. While the company's one-month and six-month plans are relatively expensive, two-year subscriptions are very affordable.

**Review**: [**Private Internet Ac** **cess: A cheap, powerful, open-source VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/private-internet-access-review/)

ZDNET has consistently found PIA to be a solid VPN; customers say the same. PIA's VPN offers server connections in 91 countries, multi-hopping, split tunneling, ad and malware blocking, and encryption capabilities. PIA takes security seriously with its no-logs policy. 

The VPN is open-source, so third parties can examine its code, which gives credibility to the company as a secure offering.

Currently, the best price for this VPN is $2.19 per month, with two months of free access added to a two-year contract. Alternatively, a six-month subscription is equivalent to $7.50 per month, and a one-month subscription costs $11.99.

Pros 
* Expansive server network
* Fast
* The best MBG available
* Six-month plans

Cons

* Expensive monthly contract

### CyberGhost

#### Best cheap VPN for money-back guarantee

CyberGhost is an affordable VPN that offers high levels of encryption, DNS leak protection, split tunneling, customizable security options, and a vast network of over 100+ countries. Unfortunately, simultaneous connections are limited to seven devices.

Customers find this VPN very easy to use, fast, and stable, although some users say streaming services can be problematic. We've found this VPN provides reasonable speeds and is a good option for torrenting.

**Also:** [**The best VPNs for streaming**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-vpn/)

Currently, the company is offering a deal on two-year subscriptions: $2.19 per month with two months free. There's also an interesting option you don't often find with VPN providers -- a six-month plan for $6.99 per month. A one-month contract is $12.99\. 

CyberGhost also offers a 45-day money-back guarantee for long contracts, which is more than most VPN providers. So, you can sign up for a plan, enjoy it, and you have weeks to decide if you want to commit to the contract.

**CyberGhost** **features**: **Money-back guarantee:** 45 days | **Platforms:** Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Linux, game consoles, and more | **Simultaneous connections:** seven | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Logging:** Payment information only | **Countries:** 100+ | **Servers**: 10,300+ | **Trial**: 24 days on macOS and Windows; three days on Android, seven days on iOS

## Which is the best cheap VPN for you?

The best cheap VPN depends on various factors besides price. If you choose a low-cost service but can't unblock the streaming services you want to use, then what did you really save? Start by asking yourself why you need a VPN. Then, test out a reputable provider with high-security standards.

If you want to learn more about how VPNs work and how to choose the best one for you, check out our guide: [What is a VPN, and why do we need one?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-how-does-it-work/)

## Factors to consider when choosing a cheap VPN

When you are deciding what VPN to sign up for, there are several factors you should consider:

* **Plan length**: Before signing up for a new VPN service, consider which subscription length is right for you. Month-by-month plans are considerably more expensive than longer plans, of which you can choose six-month to five-year plans. We find that the longest terms are almost always the cheapest.
* **Price**: The cost of your VPN subscription should naturally factor into your decision. Choose one that is affordable for you, especially if you are signing up for a year or more.
* **Tax**: Some VPN providers, such as those based in the US, may add taxes to the cost of a contract.
* **Upfront cost**: Most VPNs market their wares at an equivalent monthly price, but they may require a higher upfront cost. You'll still secure a great monthly cost, but you might have to pay for the full plan in one go.
* **Features**: Many cheap VPNs don't offer advanced features on their basic or longest plans. You may need to pay more for a specific feature, such as a password manager.
* **Use cases**: If you want a VPN for a specific purpose beyond day-to-day browsing -- such as [traveling](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-travel-vpn/) \-- check whether the VPN is suitable. You may need to opt for a particular VPN if you want to use it in different countries, for example, or you may want to choose a VPN known for great streaming support.
* **Renewal terms**: Automatic renewal and billing might sting you in the future, especially if the VPN's pricing has changed. You might want to turn off auto-renewal and shop around for a new deal instead.

## How we test VPNs

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

We tested and analyzed the best cheap VPNs in 2024 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** We tested most of the VPNs on this list to ensure robust performance in terms of connection and speed. After all, there's no point in using a VPN if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well considering these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while streaming.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive apps suitable for various hardware.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days.

## How do free months on a VPN contract work?

Free months, added as an incentive for users to sign up for a VPN service, are typically added to the length of your contract. For example, if you sign up for a two-year contract with three months free, you pay for 24 months of access and then enjoy an additional three months free.

## Should I use a VPN on my phone or tablet?

If you want your data to be secure, then yes. VPNs offer protection no matter what kind of device you use to transmit and receive data. Before you commit to a VPN service, it's a good idea to test it out and see how well it works with all your devices. The [best VPN for Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-vpn/) may not be the same as the [best VPN for iOS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/), and vice versa.

## Can using a VPN get you cheaper flights?

A VPN may help you get cheaper flights by connecting you with foreign servers and hiding your IP address. That said, airline prices shift based on various factors, and the impact of changing your location could be negligible or, at the very least, hard to confirm. 

It's worth trying to use a VPN to save money on flights. We've managed to score slightly cheaper long-haul flights by appearing to come from the destination country, for example, but the discounts haven't been huge. 

## Does a VPN slow down my connection?

Let's be clear: Yes. A VPN will slow your connection because your data is encrypted, decrypted, and sent through intermediate servers. Your online gaming experience might suffer. If you're a first-person shooter player, you might have enough lag to miss shots. That said, both computers and VPNs have gotten much faster. Years ago, VPNs caused everything to slow down far more than today's services.

Nowadays, the negative impact is almost unnoticeable, especially with the fastest VPN services. Most (but not all) VPN providers also limit the number of devices you can connect to simultaneously, so you may have to pick and choose which home devices to connect to.

## What's the best free VPN service?

In this article, we've focused on paid services, although some offer a free tier. We don't usually recommend free VPN services because we don't consider them secure, with a few exceptions, such as ProtonVPN and Windscribe. 

Running a good VPN service requires hundreds of servers worldwide and many networking resources -- it's expensive. If you're not paying to support that infrastructure, who is? Probably advertisers or data miners. What's the point of a VPN if it doesn't keep your data secure? 

That said, no tool can guarantee your privacy. First, anything can be hacked. Second, a VPN protects your data when it transits from your computer to the VPN service, but it doesn't protect what you put on servers or whatever cloud-based application you're using. It doesn't typically offer password security or multi-factor authentication unless you pay for these add-ons. Privacy and security require you to be diligent about your digital presence, and VPNs, while helpful, are not a miracle cure.

## Why are some VPNs so expensive?

While we have found the best affordable VPNs on the market, some VPNs can be expensive. They may still only cost the equivalent of your monthly subscription to Netflix, but VPNs that cost upwards of $10 per month for long-term contracts are unusual.

Usually, these VPNs provide something others do not, and if they are known to provide a fast, secure, and trustworthy service, they can bump up the price. An example is Astrill VPN, which starts at $12.50/month. Why? It is one of the best options for Chinese nationals to circumvent the country's censorship and web restrictions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Can I pay for a VPN for one month?

You can, but paying for one month will be expensive. To deter customers from doing so, many VPN providers charge over $10 for four weeks of access. A better option could be to sign up for a one- or two-year contract, take advantage of a money-back guarantee -- which is usually 30 days -- and cancel before the month is up.
