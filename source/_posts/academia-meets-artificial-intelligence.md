![Sementic Scholar results page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/semantic-scholar-screenshot.jpg)

 AI-powered research tools like Semantic Scholar make the research process much easier. Semantic Scholar uses AI algorithms to help you extract important information from research articles, as well as enabling you to understand the context of research papers.

 This tool also allows researchers to quickly look through papers with TL;DRs. TL;DR stands for **Too Long; Didn’t Read**. A TL;DR gives you short summaries of a research paper to help you get what you need to know regarding the objective and outcome of the research. Using Semantic Scholar also means you can avoid manually formatting citations, as it gives you the option to cite any paper.

 Just like Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar also makes use of AI to help you [research like a pro](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-scholar-search-tips/). With Google Scholar, researchers get to enjoy receiving relevant search results through AI algorithms. You can also use the automatic citation feature to avoid doing it yourself. But it’s still important to ensure that the citation format is accurate.

 ChatGPT can help researchers navigate easily through their research processes by answering queries. When you [use prompts in ChatGPT correctly](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-mistakes-to-avoid/), ChatGPT can lead you to sources related to your research topic. You can retrieve key information, article summaries, brainstorm ideas, or find connections between multiple research papers.

 ChatGPT is effective in aiding your research process and can help you cut down the time you spend on specific tasks, but it should not be used as a replacement for appropriate research methods.
