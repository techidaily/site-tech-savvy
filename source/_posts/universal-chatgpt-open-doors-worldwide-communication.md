 Before getting started, you have to log in to your ChatGPT account. You can do so separately, or enter a prompt and hit **Ask** for a login request to appear. It's worth mentioning that the extension will send the queries to ChatGPT via API, and these will show up as conversations on your ChatGPT account.

 Once installed, bring up the overlay window by hitting **Ctrl + Space** on your keyboard, or tapping the extension's icon in your browser's toolbar. Here you can select **General** or **Email** in a dropdown menu. **General** is for common prompts that you would typically use with ChatGPT and will provide responses that you'd normally get on the ChatGPT website.

 The **Email** option can be especially usefulâ€“it can grab content from an email and auto-generate a reply. It's cordial, stays on topic, and answers every part of an incoming message. For both **General** and **Email** prompts, there are ways you can fine-tune the outputs if you're not satisfied with what's produced.

 To make changes, open the [ChatGPT site](https://chat.openai.com/chat), log in, and check your latest chat sessions. Here, you can see the modifications made by ChatGPT Everywhere when pinging the service. Here, all you have to do is make adjustments to the prompt that the extension generated and send it again.
