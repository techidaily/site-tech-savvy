## Innovate Your Hobbies: From Board Gaming to Digital Art with My Bots

### Key Takeaways

* OpenAI released a bunch of "My GPT" modes for ChatGPT-4, including features like DALL-E for image creation and Data Analysis for document results.
* ChatGPT Classic is available for those who prefer a simpler version without additional functionalities.
* Other new modes include a Tech Support Advisor, a Sous Chef, and a Math Mentor, providing assistance for various tasks and interests.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 OpenAI just released a list of new ChatGPT modes called "My GPT." that essentially add flavor to ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E, gearing them specifically to be better suited for certain tasks.

 You'll find "My GPTs" in the **Explore** tab on ChatGPT's side menu. It's full of custom GPT modes ranging from a fun memes translator to a tech support advisor, and this is how each of OpenAI's pre-built options work.

## 1\. DALL-E

![DALL-E generating a dragonborn paladin image on ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dall-e-generating-a-dragonborn-paladin-image-on-chatgpt.jpg)

 DALL-E allows you to create images left entirely to your imagination. And you can improve the images with follow-up prompts.

 From documents to spreadsheets, upload your data to ChatGPT's Data Analysis mode to quickly draw results from your documents. Be careful, though, as [the AI's results may be inaccurate](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/).

## 3\. ChatGPT Classic

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 ChatGPT-4 now has DALL-E 3, browsing, and provision to upload files. However, if you want to return to a simpler ChatGPT without all those functionalities, that's what ChatGPT Classic is for.

## 4\. Game Time

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Do you have a board game somewhere at home that you don't know how to play? Game Time comes in clutch and can explain cards and board games to you. You can also upload images if you don't know what the game is called but have the instructions or an idea of what it is.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

[ChatGPT has always been great for creative writing](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-creative-writing/), but Creative Writing Coach takes it up a notch. You can consult it to do some research for you or paste your excerpts so it can help improve your style and delivery.

## 7\. Cosmic Dream

![Van Gogh re-interpretation of Mona Lisa using ChatGPT Cosmic Dream](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/van-gogh-re-interpretation-of-mona-lisa-using-chatgpt-cosmic-dream.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Cosmic Dream offers artistic inspiration and compelling art themes based on your prompts. It can go off with a single word or a set of instructions on what style you want. However, it tries not to redo works of artists made after 1912\.

![Tech Support Advisor giving tips on changing VPN on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tech-support-advisor-giving-tips-on-changing-vpn-on-macos.jpg)

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095385/26400" target="_top" id="2095385"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095385" border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="1024"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095385/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

 Kids will love the endless coloring book possibilities that Coloring Book Hero provides. It makes black-and-white printable art in an unserious, whimsical, and child-friendly style. Get creative with your prompts, and ask for more details if you want more of a challenge.

## 10\. Laundry Buddy

 Laundry Buddy is a surprisingly useful laundry assistant dedicated to helping you keep your clothes in good condition. Its standout feature, though, is its ability to read and understand clothing labels and decipher laundry signs on tags.

## 11\. Sous Chef

![Sous Chef on ChatGPT with an image of a sandwich](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sous-chef-on-chatgpt-with-an-image-of-a-sandwich.jpeg)

 Whip up alternative recipes and brainstorm menu options with ChatGPT's Sous Chef. It's perfect for using context to create meal ideas and grocery lists. OpenAI also gave it image generation capabilities that let you see what your potential meals should look like.

![Sticker Whiz creating a Gandalf sticker on ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sticker-whiz-creating-a-gandalf-sticker-on-chatgpt.jpg)

 When you think "sticker," your mind may go to digital onesâ€”and you'll be wrong in this case. Sticker Whiz is for designing custom real-life application stickers you can buy and order on Sticker Mule. After you finish your design, Sticker Whiz will generate a link you can follow to buy your order.

## 13\. Math Mentor

![Math Mentor analyzing a piece of written math problem](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-mentor-analyzing-a-piece-of-written-math-problem.jpg)

 Math Mentor expands on [ChatGPT's math-solving skills](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-solve-math-problems/) by integrating image-processing capabilities and a more accurate mathematics engine. It can understand hand-written math problems and identify issues while guiding enquirers to the right answer.

## 14\. Hot Mods

![Hot Mods on ChatGPT with an image of a retro-style black muscle car](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hot-mods-on-chatgpt-with-an-image-of-a-retro-style-black-muscle-car.jpg)

It's fast, runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, comes with a cover design editor, and allows book variations to be created with alternate text, style sheets and cover designs. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

## 15\. Mocktail Mixologist

![Mocktail Mixologist recommending an iced tea-based mocktail](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mocktail-mixologist-recommending-an-iced-tea-based-mocktail.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Mocktail Mixologist is the non-alcoholic beverage version of Sous Chef. Tell it what ingredients and contexts you have, and it will give you instructions on making a mocktail to that effect. It's designed to have a bubbly personality (to match the drinks, perhaps), and it can also generate images of drinks.

## 15\. Genz 4 Meme

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobileâ€¦ Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

## 15\. Mocktail Mixologist

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobileâ€¦ Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 OpenAI just released a list of new ChatGPT modes called "My GPT." that essentially add flavor to ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E, gearing them specifically to be better suited for certain tasks.

 You'll find "My GPTs" in the **Explore** tab on ChatGPT's side menu. It's full of custom GPT modes ranging from a fun memes translator to a tech support advisor, and this is how each of OpenAI's pre-built options work.

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

![Tech Support Advisor giving tips on changing VPN on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tech-support-advisor-giving-tips-on-changing-vpn-on-macos.jpg)

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

## 9\. Coloring Book Hero

 Laundry Buddy is a surprisingly useful laundry assistant dedicated to helping you keep your clothes in good condition. Its standout feature, though, is its ability to read and understand clothing labels and decipher laundry signs on tags.

## 11\. Sous Chef

## 13\. Math Mentor

## 14\. Hot Mods

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

 Mocktail Mixologist is the non-alcoholic beverage version of Sous Chef. Tell it what ingredients and contexts you have, and it will give you instructions on making a mocktail to that effect. It's designed to have a bubbly personality (to match the drinks, perhaps), and it can also generate images of drinks.

## 15\. Genz 4 Meme

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobileâ€¦ Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.
