**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 You no longer have to leave ChatGPT to generate AI images. OpenAI has integrated its flagship AI image generation tool, DALL-E, into ChatGPT’s chats. Thanks to this, you only have to prompt ChatGPT to generate an image, similar to how you would prompt it to generate text.

 While prompting may be easy enough, we’ll show you how to know what GPTs in ChatGPT support DALL-E’s image generation. We’ll also tell you how to prompt ChatGPT to generate images when and how you want.

## Sign Up for ChatGPT Plus to Access DALL-E

 DALL-E’s image generation features on ChatGPT are locked behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus (and Team) subscription. It’s just one of the many [reasons you should consider upgrading to ChatGPT Plus](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-should-upgrade-chatgpt-plus/). GPT-3.5 doesn’t have embedded image generation abilities, and you’ll be unable to access GPTs with DALL-E’s capabilities.

 If you’re new to this, here’s how to upgrade your subscription on the web:

1. Visit [ChatGPT’s website](https://chat.openai.com/) and log in.
2. Click the **Upgrade plan** button in the bottom-left corner of the side panel, just above your name.  
![ChatGPT upgrade plan window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-2024-01-21-at-11-02-26-am.png)
3. Choose **Upgrade to Plus** (or **Upgrade to Team**).
4. Fill in your payment information and click **Subscribe**.

 After doing this, you should now have access to DALL-E. It’s still a good idea to refresh your browser or log out and in again to make sure everything is in working order.

 Unlike DALL-E 2, DALL-E 3 doesn’t have a standalone website for you to access, you can only access it officially through a ChatGPT subscription. And it’s better to pay for a versatile ChatGPT with superior image generation than to buy credits on DALL-E 2\. We’d recommend you save DALL-E 2 for when you need an AI image at no cost or if you ever need to [use DALL-E 2’s outpainting tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/dall-e-2-outpainting-how-to-use/).
