 OpenAI just released a list of new ChatGPT modes called "My GPT." that essentially add flavor to ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E, gearing them specifically to be better suited for certain tasks.

 You'll find "My GPTs" in the **Explore** tab on ChatGPT's side menu. It's full of custom GPT modes ranging from a fun memes translator to a tech support advisor, and this is how each of OpenAI's pre-built options work.

## 1\. DALL-E

## 4\. Game Time

![Game Time on ChatGPT explaining Holdem Poker](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/game-time-on-chatgpt-explaining-holdem-poker.jpg)

 Do you have a board game somewhere at home that you don't know how to play? Game Time comes in clutch and can explain cards and board games to you. You can also upload images if you don't know what the game is called but have the instructions or an idea of what it is.

![Using Creative Writing Coach in ChatGPT-4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/using-creative-writing-coach-in-chatgpt-4.jpg)

[ChatGPT has always been great for creative writing](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-creative-writing/), but Creative Writing Coach takes it up a notch. You can consult it to do some research for you or paste your excerpts so it can help improve your style and delivery.

## 7\. Cosmic Dream

![Van Gogh re-interpretation of Mona Lisa using ChatGPT Cosmic Dream](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/van-gogh-re-interpretation-of-mona-lisa-using-chatgpt-cosmic-dream.jpg)

 Cosmic Dream offers artistic inspiration and compelling art themes based on your prompts. It can go off with a single word or a set of instructions on what style you want. However, it tries not to redo works of artists made after 1912\.

![Tech Support Advisor giving tips on changing VPN on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tech-support-advisor-giving-tips-on-changing-vpn-on-macos.jpg)

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

## 9\. Coloring Book Hero

![Laundry Buddy analyzing a shirt label on ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/laundry-buddy-analyzing-a-shirt-label-on-chatgpt.jpg)

 Whip up alternative recipes and brainstorm menu options with ChatGPT's Sous Chef. It's perfect for using context to create meal ideas and grocery lists. OpenAI also gave it image generation capabilities that let you see what your potential meals should look like.

## 12\. Sticker Whiz

![Sticker Whiz creating a Gandalf sticker on ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sticker-whiz-creating-a-gandalf-sticker-on-chatgpt.jpg)

 When you think "sticker," your mind may go to digital ones—and you'll be wrong in this case. Sticker Whiz is for designing custom real-life application stickers you can buy and order on Sticker Mule. After you finish your design, Sticker Whiz will generate a link you can follow to buy your order.

## 13\. Math Mentor

<a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605" border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

![Math Mentor analyzing a piece of written math problem](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-mentor-analyzing-a-piece-of-written-math-problem.jpg)

 Math Mentor expands on [ChatGPT's math-solving skills](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-solve-math-problems/) by integrating image-processing capabilities and a more accurate mathematics engine. It can understand hand-written math problems and identify issues while guiding enquirers to the right answer.

## 14\. Hot Mods

![Hot Mods on ChatGPT with an image of a retro-style black muscle car](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hot-mods-on-chatgpt-with-an-image-of-a-retro-style-black-muscle-car.jpg)

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

## 15\. Mocktail Mixologist

![Mocktail Mixologist recommending an iced tea-based mocktail](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mocktail-mixologist-recommending-an-iced-tea-based-mocktail.jpg)

 Mocktail Mixologist is the non-alcoholic beverage version of Sous Chef. Tell it what ingredients and contexts you have, and it will give you instructions on making a mocktail to that effect. It's designed to have a bubbly personality (to match the drinks, perhaps), and it can also generate images of drinks.

## 15\. Genz 4 Meme

![genz 4 meme explaining a Zoolander meme](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/genz-4-meme-explaining-a-zoolander-meme.jpg)

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 OpenAI just released a list of new ChatGPT modes called "My GPT." that essentially add flavor to ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E, gearing them specifically to be better suited for certain tasks.

 You'll find "My GPTs" in the **Explore** tab on ChatGPT's side menu. It's full of custom GPT modes ranging from a fun memes translator to a tech support advisor, and this is how each of OpenAI's pre-built options work.

 Cosmic Dream offers artistic inspiration and compelling art themes based on your prompts. It can go off with a single word or a set of instructions on what style you want. However, it tries not to redo works of artists made after 1912\.

![Tech Support Advisor giving tips on changing VPN on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tech-support-advisor-giving-tips-on-changing-vpn-on-macos.jpg)

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

 Laundry Buddy is a surprisingly useful laundry assistant dedicated to helping you keep your clothes in good condition. Its standout feature, though, is its ability to read and understand clothing labels and decipher laundry signs on tags.

## 11\. Sous Chef

![Sous Chef on ChatGPT with an image of a sandwich](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sous-chef-on-chatgpt-with-an-image-of-a-sandwich.jpeg)

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

## 15\. Mocktail Mixologist

![Mocktail Mixologist recommending an iced tea-based mocktail](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mocktail-mixologist-recommending-an-iced-tea-based-mocktail.jpg)

 Mocktail Mixologist is the non-alcoholic beverage version of Sous Chef. Tell it what ingredients and contexts you have, and it will give you instructions on making a mocktail to that effect. It's designed to have a bubbly personality (to match the drinks, perhaps), and it can also generate images of drinks.

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.
