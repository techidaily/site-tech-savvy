### 1\. Export Your Data

 ChatGPT gives you the option to export your account data. This includes your profile information, conversations, and prompts. [Export your ChatGPT data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-export-chatgpt-data/) before deleting your account, just in case you want to use it again or access some conversations later.

### 2\. Save Your Favorite Prompts

 If you have any favorite ChatGPT prompts, save them before deleting your account. You can easily save these prompts by copying and pasting them into a document.

### 3\. Review Your Subscription

 If you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you may need to cancel your subscription separately from deleting your account. Reviewing your subscription will help ensure you do not incur any unexpected charges.

 And that's it! You have successfully deleted your ChatGPT account.

 Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. You also won't be able to reuse the same email address and phone number to create a new account.
