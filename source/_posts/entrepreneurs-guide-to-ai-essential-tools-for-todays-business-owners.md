 Unlike ChatGPT, [Google Cloud Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) isn’t a chatbot itself; it’s a tool that allows you to build realistic conversations for your own chatbots. The scope of this tool is incredible, with Google’s wealth of data contributing to training algorithms that make it very easy to make responsive chatbots.

 This is great for businesses that want to greet users and help them on their website, provide support for users, and even handle sales flows that would otherwise require a person to help. The main downside of Dialogflow is the learning curve.

 It’s time to look at another tool from OpenAI. [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) is an image generator that uses text-based prompts to create artwork from data.

## 5\. Grammarly Grammar Extensions

![grammarly ai website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/grammarly-ai-homepage.jpg)
