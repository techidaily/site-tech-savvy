## How to Update Video Drivers in Windows 10. Easily

If you just upgraded to Windows 10 or reinstalled Windows 10, you may want to update the video drivers. If your computer is slow, you can try to update the graphics drivers to boost the PC’s performance. If your computer gets problems due to video driver issues, you may want to update the drivers. For whatever reason,**you can update the video drivers easily** .

 There are**three** methods to update the video drivers. You can choose the method you like, but please note not every method surely works. If one method doesn’t work, try another method until you update the video drivers successfully.

1. **[Update video drivers via the Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Download and install new drivers from manufacturers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update video drivers automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Method 1: Update video drivers via the Device Manager

 You can download and install the new video drivers via the Device Manager. Follow the steps below:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** key at the same time to invoke the**Run** command. Type **devmgmt.msc**  and press**Enter** to open Device Manager.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a1299e9140b3.png)
2. In Device Manager, expand the **Display adapters**  category. Right click your graphics card and select **Update driver** (In some cases, this might be Update Driver Software).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a12a0594834c.png)
3. In the pop-up window, you will see two options. Click **Search automatically for updated driver software** . Then Windows will find and install drivers for your video device automatically.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a12a0a3b3b6a.png)

 Repeat the steps above to update drivers for each graphics card if you’ve installed more than one graphics card.

## Method 2: Download and install new drivers from manufacturers

 You can download and install the drivers manually if you know what you’re doing. Both PC manufacturers and device manufacturers provide drivers. If you’re using a prebuilt desktop or a laptop, it’s recommended you go to the PC manufacturer’s website, as they will customize the driver. If you built the desktop on your own or if the PC manufacturer doesn’t provide the new video drivers you need, you can download the drivers from the graphics card manufacturer.

### Download the video drivers from PC manufacturers

 To download the correct drivers from PC manufacturers, you need to get the PC model name and the Specific Operating System (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit ). Then you can download the drivers from the**SUPPORT** page of the website.

 If you don’t know the PC model name or the specific version of Windows 10, you can find it out by checking the System Information. Follow these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** key at the same time to invoke a run command. Type**msinfo32** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a12971baa255.png)
2. The**System Model** is the PC model name. In my case, the PC model is Vostro 3900.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a1297d215761.jpg)
3. The**System Type** is the specific Windows version. In my case, the version is Windows 10 64-bit.

### Download the video drivers from graphics card manufacturers

 To download the correct drivers from the graphics card manufacturer, you need to know the graphics card model and the specific Windows version. Then you can download the drivers from the**SUPPORT** page.

 If you’re not sure what graphics card you’ve installed, you can check it via Device Manager. Follow the steps below. If you’re not sure what the specific Windows 10 version is, refer to the steps in **[Download the video drivers from PC manufacturers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to get the information.
