 Hugging Face is a company and open-source community focused on the field of artificial intelligence. Like GitHub, Hugging Face provides a platform for people to collaborate, learn, and share work in [natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/). At its core, Hugging Face aims to provide people with all the essential tools, libraries, and resources needed to work on NLP models for their benefit.

 Before becoming a platform for AI, Hugging Face was first introduced as a chatbot in 2016 to entertain and provide emotional support for teenagers. The Hugging Face brand came from the hugging face emoji to look caring and friendly for the teens trying to chat with it. To this day, Hugging Face has kept its branding even though it switched from a chatbot app for mobile to the large community it is today.
