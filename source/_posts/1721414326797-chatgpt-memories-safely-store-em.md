1. Select any of your previously saved chats on the left sidebar.
2. Click the edit icon and change the title appropriately.
3. Finally, click the checkmark to save the new title.

## Save Your ChatGPT Conversations to a TXT File

 While you can [share ChatGPT conversations](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/) with others and export your entire chat history, ChatGPT doesn't have a feature that lets you download individual conversations to your local disk.

 You can achieve this by manually copying and pasting your chat into a text file. To copy your conversations manually:

2. Proceed by holding down **Shift + PgDn** on your keyboard until you reach the last text in the conversation thread.
3. Once on the last text, press **Ctrl + C** or **Cmd + C** on your keyboard or right-click and select **Copy** to copy the chat to your clipboard.
4. Open the Notepad or any text editor on your computer and paste this conversation into it. Then save the file with a TXT extension.
