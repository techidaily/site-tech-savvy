## Top 6 Typical GPT Car-Related Setup Glitches & Fixes

 Installing Auto-GPT on your computer can be a challenging task. Although the provided installation guide is simple, the fact that the project is still under development can cause problems during installation. And since logs and documentation can be pretty long and confusing, non-developers may need help troubleshooting issues that may arise during installation.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Since guides on Auto-GPT involves the use of niche technologies and technical terminologies, troubleshooting problems with little understanding can lead to frustration.

 To make it easier for you, we've compiled a list of the six most common issues when it comes to installing Auto-GPT on a computer.

## 1\. Bad git executable

![Bad git executable](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bad-git.jpg)

 Git is a version control system that manages and tracks project code changes and is used to collaborate with other developers. When you try to install something from GitHub without installing Git on your local device, you may get an import error known as **Bad git executable**.

**Bad git executable** error is thrown because your computer is trying to run a git executable without the ability to use Git commands.

 You can easily correct the problem by downloading and installing git on your local machine. To install [git](https://git-scm.com/), you can go to their official website to download their software and run the installer.

 Alternatively, you can open up a terminal by right-clicking on your desktop and selecting **Open in Terminal**. After opening the terminal, you can install git by using the command:

`winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

 Once installed, restart your computer and run Auto-GPT as usual. If you still get the error, you will have to redownload the Auto-GPT source code and repeat your installation.

## 2\. Missing auto-gpt.json

![Missing JSON file on AutoGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/000-errors.jpg)

 JSON is a data format popularly used in web APIs like Auto-GPT. It is used to transmit and manage structured data between client and server. You can get a warning about a missing **auto-gpt.json** file because Auto-GPT is trying to locally save data but is unable to locate the JSON file.

 The **auto-gpt.json** file is supposed to be generated during installation, but if this process fails, you can create the JSON file yourself. The simplest way to resolve the issue is to copy any JSON file within your source code folder and format it as your **auto-gpt.json** file.

 To start, you'll want to open your source code folder and go to **autogpt** \>> **json\_utils**. Copy **llm\_response\_format\_1.json,** then paste it into the root folder (Auto-GPT-X.X.X).

![Copy JASON file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/copy-jason-file.jpg)

 Now, open the file using Notepad and delete all content and save. You should now have an empty JSON; all you have to do now is rename it to **autogpt.json**.

 Although you can try creating a new text file and saving it as **autogpt.json**, its file type would still indicate it as a text document instead of a JSON file. So, to ensure that our file worked, we had to copy a file already tagged as a JSON file.

## 3\. No module named autogpt

![No module named autogpt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/no-module.jpg)

 Auto-GPT runs on an environment located in its source code folder. If you try to run Auto-GPT anywhere else, you'll be prompted with **No module named autogpt**. This typically happens when people try to run Auto-GPT for the second time, not knowing that Auto-GPT needs to be directed to the proper path to function.

 You can easily resolve this by opening your terminal inside the Auto-GPT's source code folder. To do so, right-click on your source code folder and select **Open in Terminal**.

## 4\. Auto-GPT Stuck on Thinking Phase (Bad Gateway)

![Auto-GPT bad gateway](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/error.jpg)

 When running an AI assistant, Auto-GPT will go through a process of thinking, reasoning, planning, criticism, and execution. It shouldn't take long before your AI assistant goes through the cycle. But in cases where the AI is stuck in the thinking phase, it may be because you don't have the credentials to use OpenAI's GPT model.

 Because anyone can generate an OpenAI API key without setting up their payment method, people may think that it is optional. Unless you have unexpired free credits, it is required that you log in to your account and set up your payment method.

 Remember, [Auto-GPT is different from ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-auto-gpt-how-differ-from-chatgpt/). Although they both use the same GPT model, Auto-GPT needs a separate OpenAI payment method from your ChatGPT account.

## 5\. API Key Not Set in ENV

![API key not set in .env](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/set-your-openai-api-key-in-env-or-as-an-environment-variable.jpg)

 Auto-GPT uses API keys as credentials to use OpenAI's GPT technology. Without an API key, you won't be allowed to use GPT. If you've made sure you've added your API key in the **.env** file but still get the same issue, you will need to hard code your API key into the configuration file within the Auto-GPT folder.

 To hard code your API key, you'll want to go to **Auto-GPT** \>> **autogpt** \>> **config**, then open the **config.py** file using Notepad or any other code editor.

 Once opened, you will see various API Keys and service configurations. You can then manually scan for the OpenAI API key variable to place your API key. Alternatively, you can hold **CTRL + F**, and type **self.openai\_api\_key**, then hit **Enter**.

 Once you've located the API key variable, delete all the elements after the "=" sign with your OpenAI API key. Since the variable is a placeholder for a string, you'll want to add quotation marks on both ends of your API key. You can now save the file and run Auto-GPT as normal.

 Since the OpenAI API key from the **.env** file didn't work, it is likely that the other API keys you've added to the **.env** file also donâ€™t work. So, if you're pairing Auto-GPT with other web API services, you'll also have to hard code them into the **config.py** file.

## 6\. Python Path Issues

 You need to install Python to run Auto-GPT on your computer and set its path. Getting issues about pip not being recognized as a function means that either Python wasn't properly installed or you need to correctly set its path.

 You can [set the Python path on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/python-windows-path/) through the [edit environment variables](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-windows-10/) panel, but the simplest way to resolve the issue is to use the Python installer.

 To add the correct path using the installer, you'll want to locate or download the Python installer on your computer. Then, run the installer and go to advanced options by selecting **Modify** \>> **Next**. In the advanced options menu, tick **Add Python to environment variables** then click **Install**. This should set the proper path for Python and allow you to use it in any location or environment.

## Easier Installation in the Future

 With Auto-GPT still in its early development phase, making a user-friendly installer isn't their top priority. To access Auto-GPT, you are expected to download the source code, configure files, install dependencies, and troubleshoot issues. But once Auto-GPT gets out of its beta stage, you can expect easier installs and maybe even a fully compiled application if the makers decide itâ€™s ready for mass usage.
