Govee's Permanent Outdoor Lights are already a [popular smart light string](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Permanent-Waterproof-Lighting-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB0BCQ926C1%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C0732191c-49af-4b4a-b0cb-47f0325da749%7Cdtp&dtb=1) because they solve a big problem for many homeowners. You can leave them up all year and not worry about them becoming damaged by the elements. Now, the smart home device manufacturer is launching a second generation of these lights, the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights 2.

The latest Permanent Outdoor Lights feature enhanced overall performance, with Govee increasing the brightness by up to 55%, improving the lights' reliability, and adding Matter support. Govee also says it added white lights for daily use and security, though the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 are still the same price as the previous model.

These lights can go up now and stay put year-round, easily transitioning from holiday lights to setting the mood for a graduation party, Fourth of July barbecue, or themed birthday party.
