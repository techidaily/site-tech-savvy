## Seamless Vehicle Upgrades via AI Collaboration

 Embarking on a journey of car tuning and modification can be daunting if you don’t have knowledge or experience. If you have an idea of what you want to achieve but aren’t sure what steps you need to take to get there, you can ask ChatGPT for answers, and it will provide a lot of valuable insight.

 The level of detail in ChatGPT’s answer can vary a lot depending on how specific your question is. You can ask it to provide a basic explanation of what you need to do and then expand upon each point individually if you still find the instructions unclear.

## ChatGPT Can Be a Tiny Tuning Guru

 The idea to [ask ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/) about car modifications arose out of my desire to challenge this AI-powered chatbot. What I asked was how I could extract 300 horsepower out of a naturally aspirated 1.2-liter engine without resorting to forced induction (turbocharging or supercharging), in an effort to turn a hypothetical small city car into a track day tool.

 After typing my instructions, it took ChatGPT around 10 seconds (slightly longer than usual) to begin typing instructions on how to achieve the above goal. Its message started with a disclaimer stating that while my request was technically possible, it would be very difficult, and to achieve the desired power output, the engine would risk losing reliability and day-to-day usability.

 ChatGPT next came up with a list of steps to increase my theoretical engine’s power output. One of the steps also mentioned additional supporting modifications (brakes, suspension, and body strengthening) that would be necessary to make sure the car this engine was in (which presumably wasn’t designed to take this much power) would still be safe to drive.

 The [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/real-life/article-12220701/What-modifications-make-car-faster-Man-uses-ChatGPT-modify-Skoda-Superb-equivalent-Audi-RS3.html) published a report focused on a car enthusiast from Australia who asked ChatGPT to help him increase the performance level of his Škoda Superb to levels comparable to an Audi RS3\. He followed the chatbot’s instructions and says he was very pleased with the result of the suggested modifications.

## ChatGPT Can Help Troubleshoot Car Problems

 Tuning a car’s engine to give it much more power than it originally had will put extra stress on many components, which could break. When that inevitably happens, you will again be able to use ChatGPT for help. You will provide it with the symptoms and codes the vehicle is displaying, and it should give you an idea of what’s wrong.

 Using ChatGPT in this way to help you pinpoint problems is also useful for vehicles that haven’t had any tuning done to them at all. For instance, when your car stops working, and you become stranded on the side of the road, if you have internet access, you could try to diagnose what the issue is with AI. If you also have a [dedicated car maintenance app](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-car-maintenance-and-tips/) and a dongle that [can connect to your car's OBD-II port](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-obd2-vehicle-diagnostic-apps/), finding out what's wrong should become a lot easier.

 In some instances, the fix will be an easy DIY job that requires no special skills or tools, and ChatGPT could get you back on the road without having to call a tow truck. If you give it enough information, chatbot could suggest you check if a specific fuse is blown, or it could teach you a secret button combination that could give you access to a secret menu in your vehicle’s trip computer that would reveal the nature of your problem.

## Use ChatGPT to Tune Your Car, but Use It Wisely

 While you shouldn’t rely only on ChatGPT to tell you how to modify your car (as the app recommends), it can be a valuable tool. As AI-powered technologies improve, so will their reliability and our faith in them.

 Early versions of ChatGPT still have factual inaccuracies and other types of errors, but these will be ironed out over time, and, in the not-too-distant future, maybe you will not only be able to ask a chatbot for instructions, but you could also ask it to order the parts and even set up an appointment at a nearby garage where they could be installed.

 If, however, you don’t want to go through the hassle of modifying your car to make it more fun, you can always just choose a vehicle that was designed to be fun without mods.
