## ChatGPT's iOS Application Launched

 OpenAI's ChatGPT garnered much interest when it publicly debuted in 2022, providing access to troves of information via a simple chat interface—be it travel tips or code-related logic.

 People have been looking for simple ways to access the tool ever since it blew up in popularity, but it's finally possible to do so, thanks to its official mobile app.

## ChatGPT Comes to iPhone (and Android)

 On May 18th, 2023, OpenAI introduced its own ChatGPT app for iOS via an [OpenAI blog post](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios). According to the company, the release comes from a continued increase in user interest, especially from those who love to use the tool when on the move.

 The ChatGPT app is available for download via the App Store and is free to use, like its website counterpart. The app also features the ability to sync history across all devices. OpenAI also uses the application as a touch point for [Whisper, its voice-to-text AI-powered solution](https://www.makeuseof.com/dictate-documents-openai-whisper/), allowing users to provide prompts via voice input.

 Furthermore, paying users can access GPT-4 and other [benefits of the ChatGPT Plus subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/) on the app too!

 If iOS isn't your preferred platform, know that [ChatGPT is also available for Android devices](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-is-now-available-on-android/), allowing you to bypass the somewhat clunky mobile browser experience.

## How to Download ChatGPT on Your iPhone

 To download ChatGPT on your iPhone, search the App Store with the keywords "ChatGPT" or "OpenAI." The name of the official app is ChatGPT, and it has a subtitle that reads "The official app by OpenAI."
