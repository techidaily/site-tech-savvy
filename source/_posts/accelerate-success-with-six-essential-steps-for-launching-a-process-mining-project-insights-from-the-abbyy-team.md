It is also no secret that many are utilizing numerous business intelligence tools to gain more insight into their operations and track KPIs and performance. Many times, the same data used in building BI type analytics, are also used for process mining. Ensure that you have access to this data and that it includes the three essential elements for process mining- a timestamp, unique ID, and events.
