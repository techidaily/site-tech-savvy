## Families and the World of Generative AI

 Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that leverages machine learning algorithms to generate content, including text and images, from simple prompts and contextual information.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 An example of a generative AI application is ChatGPT, an advanced text-generating chatbot you can use to generate human-like texts.

 ChatGPT's immense capabilities make it a powerful tool, and it's understandable why any parent might hesitate to grant unrestricted access to their children.

## What Is ChatGPT?

 OpenAI's ChatGPT uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate text and can answer almost any question you ask. In case you're wondering, GPT stands for [Generative Pre-trained Transformer](https://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-models-explained-and-compared/), the machine learning model used to train ChatGPT.

 ChatGPT can write poems and computer code, generate stories, and other forms of written content. One distinguishing ChatGPT feature is its natural and realistic responses, much like how humans write and speak.

## How Does ChatGPT Work?

 ChatGPT was trained using massive amounts of data from the internet and works in much the same way as many other chatbots.

 To [get started using ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/), create an account on the OpenAI website. Then, type your prompt (question or command) in the text bar at the bottom of the page and press **Enter** to generate a response.

 ChatGPT is unique in that it remembers previous conversations and can generate responses based on them.

 ChatGPT's ability to understand context and generate relevant responses means that it can write practically anything. For example, it can write social media posts, draft blog posts, and create book outlines.

 Furthermore, ChatGPT can summarize books and articles, translate languages, and provide research and homework assistance, making it a valuable resource for students. It can also act as a tutor, writing and debugging code, answering questions on various subjects, and providing feedback on your grammar.

## What Are the Risks of Using ChatGPT?

 Although ChatGPT has many potential benefits, there are also valid concerns about its use. A potential risk to be aware of is exposure to inappropriate content.

 Even as OpenAI strives to control ChatGPT responses, there's still a chance your children may encounter unsuitable content, including inappropriate language or adult themes.

 Another issue to consider is the possibility of generating incorrect information. ChatGPT was trained on information from the internet, so it may output incorrect responses or show biases due to errors in its training data.

 There are also concerns about plagiarism and a decrease in critical thinking. Students may use ChatGPT to complete assignments like solving equations and writing papers, which could affect research skills and critical thinking if they rely on it.

## Should Children Use ChatGPT?

 OpenAI's [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) state that users must be at least 13 years old, and those under 18 require parental or guardian consent to use the platform. However, the platform doesn't need users to verify their age when creating an account.

 When used responsibly, ChatGPT can be a great tool for kids to generate and answer research questions about a subject and learn about AI, which is predicted to be crucial in the future.

## What Can Parents Do to Make ChatGPT Safe for Their Kids?

 One of the most important things parents can do to help their children use ChatGPT safely is to understand how it works. Then, educate them on the risks of using ChatGPT and how to use it responsibly.

 In addition, parents should encourage their children to verify the credibility of any information, as ChatGPT can be a source of misinformation.

 It's also advisable to monitor how your child uses the chatbot, particularly if they use it for school assignments. Talk with them about plagiarism and its potential risks, and inform them that educators can use their judgment and [AI text detectors](https://www.makeuseof.com/accurate-ai-text-detectors/) to spot AI-generated text.

## Use ChatGPT Safely and Responsibly

 Although ChatGPT can help with tasks like writing blog posts, essays, and code, parents need to understand the potential risks of its use. ChatGPT may generate inappropriate content, provide incorrect answers, and can be used by students to cheat on their homework.

 To use ChatGPT safely, parents are encouraged to understand how it works, educate their families about its risks, and monitor how their children use it.
