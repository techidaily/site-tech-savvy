## Enhance Engagement: Structuring GPT-Powered Discussions Through Organization

 ChatGPT's conversation memory is one of the generative AI chatbot's most useful features. Every time you start a new conversation and ask ChatGPT a question or provide a prompt, it's recorded for you to refer back to.

 But even casual ChatGPT users will have found that after a short period, the number of conversations in the history bar balloons, making it difficult to keep track of chats.

 That's where the ChatGPT Folders Chrome extension comes into play, allowing you to organize, structure, and pin your ChatGPT conversations. Here's how it works.

## How to Use ChatGPT Folders to Organize Your ChatGPT Conversations

 Let's face it; the ChatGPT conversation history isn't the chatbot's strongest feature. Having the list of prior conversations is handy, but without a way to manage it properly, it's not up to scratch.

 The [ChatGPT Folders](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-folders-organize/hkabkcpdocmhidhbgfcpbadafacnekkl) Chrome extension addresses this problem directly, adding support for folders, subfolders, pinning, bulk conversation deletion, and the option to [share your ChatGPT conversations](https://www.makeuseof.com/apps-extensions-export-share-chatgpt-history/). Now, I imagine OpenAI will add all of these features to ChatGPT in the future ([ChatGPT link sharing is already enabled](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/)). But the future isn't now, and ChatGPT Folders is delivering the goods.

### 1\. Download and Install ChatGPT Folders

 First up, head to [ChatGPT Folders](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-folders-organize/hkabkcpdocmhidhbgfcpbadafacnekkl) while using the Chrome browser, then select **Add to Chrome**.

 Launch ChatGPT to check ChatGPT Folders installed correctly. You should now find a new toolbar atop your ChatGPT conversation history with options to create a New Conversation and, most importantly, a New Folder. You'll also note that a tree structure now exists alongside your ChatGPT conversations, which you can use to select specific chats you want to move into a folder, delete, and so on.

### 2\. Create a New Folder, Add Your Conversations

 From here, you can begin creating new folders to manage your ChatGPT conversations.

1. From the top bar, select **New Folder**. Give it a name.
2. Now, select any ChatGPT conversations you want to add by selecting the check box.
3. You can either drag and drop the selected folders into your new folder or right-click and select **Move to > New Folder**.

4. Select your folder. It will open using the same tree structure, where you'll find your grouped conversations.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. **Optional**: Inside your new folder, select the **New Folder** button once more to create a subfolder. Use the same steps as before to transfer ChatGPT conversations to the subfolder.

### 3\. How to Delete a Folder and Reset Your Conversations

 Deleting a folder and resetting your conversations are two different processes, but you'll want to know about both.

 To delete a folder, right-click and select **Delete \[Folder Name\]**. Your conversations will return to their original positions in your ChatGPT history. They're not deleted as part of the process.

 However, if you decide you've had enough of your ChatGPT Folders structure and want to start again, you can use the **Reset folders and conversations** button instead.

![chatgpt folders reset conversations and folders](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-folders-reset-conversations-and-folders.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Select the three-line button at the top of the ChatGPT history, then **Reset folders and conversations**. Doing so will remove all of the ChatGPT Folders you've created and return your ChatGPT conversations to their original state. Note that this isn't the same as [deleting your ChatGPT history](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-delete-your-chatgpt-history/).

## Are ChatGPT Folders the ChatGPT Future?

 The additional functionality ChatGPT Folders brings to ChatGPT is most welcome.

 But there are some additional features we'd like to see in future updates to this extension:

* Colored folders; more customization options
* Folder and conversation export and sync (though we believe this is in the works)
* Faster loading

 Overall, the ChatGPT Folders Chrome extension is a great option for anyone using ChatGPT regularly who finds the default conversation history underwhelming.

 As said, we fully expect OpenAI to bring this functionality to ChatGPT at some point, but for now, ChatGPT Folders is just the ticket.
