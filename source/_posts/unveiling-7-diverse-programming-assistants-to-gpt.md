## Unveiling 7 Diverse Programming Assistants to GPT

 ChatGPT is a great AI tool for automatically generating code from human language prompts. However, it’s not focused specifically on code and may not integrate seamlessly into your workflow. Here are several options for more code-focused AI tools.

## 1\. GitHub Copilot

![github copilot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/github-copilot.jpg)

[GitHub Copilot is an AI assistant](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-github-copilot-helps-you-code/) developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. As you type, it suggests full lines of code for various programming languages. Copilot is trained on the public repositories available on GitHub.

 Some key features of GitHub Copilot are:

* It analyzes your code and suggests code snippets based on context. It can suggest variable names, functions, and entire lines of code.
* It can generate code based on the comments written in natural language.
* It supports programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, PHP, C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Shell.
* It is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of IDEs.

 GitHub Copilot is not free but has a 30-day free trial period. After that, you need to subscribe to an individual or a business plan to use it.

 GitHub has also released [Copilot X](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x) which uses GPT4\. It introduces more AI assistance like generated pull requests, context-aware conversations, automated testing, and command-line AI.

## 2\. Codeium

* Trained on in-house Amazon code and open-source code.
* Support for Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and TypeScript.

 CodeWhisperer is free to use for individuals but the professional tier costs $19/month per user.

## 4\. Tabnine

![tabnine homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tabnine-homepage.jpg)

 Tabnine is also an automatic code generation tool that works in your IDE. It generates the code based on your previous code and also based on your comments. Some of its key features are:

* Support for more than 30 programming languages including JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Bash
* Ability to host and train your own AI model when using the pro version which ensures your code remains yours.
* Ability to run locally or in the cloud depending on your compliance and security needs.
* Unit test generation (only available in beta as of writing).
* Integration with major IDEs such as VS Code, Neovim, Rider, and Android Studio.

 Tabnine is available in three versions: free, pro, and enterprise. The free version is very limited and only provides short code completions. The enterprise version, however, has more features. You can deploy Tabnine on-premises or on a VPC and ensure your code remains private. It also has an in-IDE chat feature.

## 5\. Codex

![codex js sandbox](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/codex-js-sandbox.jpg)

 Codex is a language model developed by OpenAI that generates code in response to natural language prompts such as a problem description. This is the model that powers GitHub Copilot. Some of its key features are:

* It supports multiple languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
* It's trained on both natural language and billions of lines of code.
* It’s available through the OpenAI Codex API, which allows developers to integrate it into their own applications and workflows.

 During the beta period, Codex is free to use. See how it works by typing in prompts in the [JavaScript code sandbox](https://platform.openai.com/codex-javascript-sandbox).

## 6\. Intellicode

 Intellicode is a free AI code-generating tool for Visual Studio. It detects the context of the code and generates suggestions. Currently, it supports Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Java programming languages. Below are some of its key features:

* It is trained on open-source projects on GitHub that have high star ratings.
* It provides API usage examples for more than 100k APIs.
* It only works exclusively with Visual Studio IDE.

 Intellicode supports a very limited number of programming languages and only works in a single IDE. Using other more flexible tools discussed in this article may be better.

## Should You Rely on Code Generators?

 AI code generators like these are very helpful in reducing the amount of code you write. However, you should not fully rely on them to write entire applications. The code they generate may not always be error-free. It’s important to thoroughly test and review the generated code before integrating it with your production code.

 It’s best to think of code assistants as tools to supplement your own coding knowledge. For instance, rely on them to generate boilerplate code or when you are working with a new programming language or framework and want to learn its syntax.
