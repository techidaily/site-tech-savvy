## Introducing Secured Login Collaboration in ProtonPass - Stay Protected Together!

There are many times when you might need to share account passwords with someone, but doing that over unencrypted SMS messages or other insecure channels isn't a great idea. [Proton's password manager](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004134/https://proton.me/pass) now has a feature to keep you safe while sharing credentials with friends and family.

 Proton Pass has introduced a new feature called Secure Links, which Proton says it's designed to change how you share your logins. Secure Links allow users to create unique, time-limited links for login credentials, bank details, notes, and other sensitive items stored in Proton Pass. These links maintain end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and intended recipient can access the shared data. The links can be set to expire after a specified time or number of views, giving you greater control over shared information. The end-to-end encryption, present here just like it's present on every product Proton makes, ensures that even Proton cannot access the content of the links.

 Proton Pass already had [secure password sharing](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/toms-gadget-guide-in-depth-reviews-of-computing-technology-and-hardware-solutions/), so this is a bit more for "casual" one-time sharing scenarios where you would paste your login and password for someone for a quick thing.

 This solution attempts to solve the common problem of insecure password sharing through messaging apps and email, which can leave data vulnerable to breaches. The feature is being rolled out initially to Proton Visionary and Lifetime plan subscribers, with availability expanding to all paid Pass plan users in the coming days. If you don't see it yet, you might need to wait a few days for it to show up.

 To celebrate the launch of this feature, Proton is offering [a limited-time promotion on its Pass Plus plan](https://account.proton.me/pass/signup?coupon=SECURESHARING&ref=securelinkpromo&currency=USD), which includes Secure Links, unlimited vaults, hide-my-email aliases, Dark Web Monitoring, Proton Sentinel security program, integrated 2FA authenticator, and more. The offer gives you all that for $12 per year, but it's [only available until July 21st.](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004134/https://proton.me/pass)
