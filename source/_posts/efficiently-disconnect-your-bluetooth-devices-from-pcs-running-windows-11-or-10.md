 If you don’t wish to keep a paired Bluetooth device, it’s easy to remove it using Settings, Device Manager, and Command Prompt. We’ll show you how to use all these methods on your Windows 11 or Windows 10 PC.

##  Remove Bluetooth Devices Using the Settings App

 A quick way to remove paired Bluetooth devices is by using Windows’ Settings app, though it is a little different in Windows 10 and Windows 11.

 If your device installed certain drivers, Settings won’t remove them. In this case, use the Device Manager method below. If you're unsure what method to use, stick to this one.

###  On Windows 11

 Launch the Settings app by pressing Windows+i. In the left sidebar, select "Bluetooth & Devices." On the right pane, choose "Devices."

 Locate the device you want to remove on the Devices page, then click the three dots next to it and choose "Remove Device."

##  Remove Bluetooth Devices Using Command Prompt

 If you prefer using command line methods over graphical ones, you can use a command in Command Prompt (or PowerShell) to remove the paired Bluetooth devices from your PC. This method achieves the same result as the graphical methods above.

 To use this method, you’ll first find your device’s instance path. The command that deletes the devices requires this path to identify your device. To find it, open Device Manager by pressing Windows+X and choosing "Device Manager."

 Expand "Bluetooth," right-click the device you want to delete, and select "Properties."

 On the Properties window, open the "Details" tab. Click the "Property" drop-down menu and select "Device Instance Path." This is the second option in the menu.

 Right-click the text displayed in the "Value" field and select "Copy."

 Close Device Manager. Open the Start Menu, search for "Command Prompt", and select "Run as Administrator."

!['Run as Administrator' highlighted for Command Prompt in the Start Menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12-open-cmd-as-admin.jpg) 

 In the User Account Control (UAC) prompt, select "Yes."

 On the Command Prompt window, type the following command, replacing "DEVICE\_ID" with the value you copied. Enclose the pasted value in double quotes.

 Then, press Enter.

 Make sure to enter the correct device instance path in the command, or you’ll accidentally end up removing a device you didn’t want to delete.

pnputil /remove-device “DEVICE_ID”
