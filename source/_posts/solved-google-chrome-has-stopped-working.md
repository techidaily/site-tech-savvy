## Bonus tips: Update your drivers with Driver Easy

 It’s always important to keep your device drivers up-to-date to make sure the hardware components are working properly on your computer and nip common errors in the bud. Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the**Scan Now** button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click**Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with[**Driver Easy Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
