 Learn how to create better AI-generated images in DALL-E 3 with this tried-and-tested list of prompts. You can use these prompts in numerous scenarios and play around with your own ideas and variations for optimal results. Let’s walk through the examples I’ve created.

**MAKEUSEOF VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

## 1  A Poster of Your Favorite Place

 There are many [websites to find unique art for your home](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-sites-find-unique-art/), but creating one in DALL-E3 is easier and more personal. One prompt you can try is asking the platform to generate a poster of your favorite place.

 I started by asking DALL-E 3 to generate a poster of the New York City skyline at dusk. While happy with the initial artwork, I wanted to adjust the format. So, I simply asked:

> “Please recreate this in 1200 x 600 format”

 And here is the final result:

![An image of the NYC skyline Created with DALL-E 3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-poster-image.jpeg)

## 2  Calendar Cover Artwork

 You can [make a printable calendar with Canva](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/make-your-own-calendar-using-canva/) and other apps, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use DALL-E 3 to generate the front cover artwork. Whether you want to gift someone your calendar or use it yourself, try using this prompt.

 I asked DALL-E 3:

> “Generate calendar cover artwork for a 2025 calendar that’ll feature artistic images of Alaska’s landscapes”

 When I asked DALL-E 3 the first time around, it gave me “20225” instead of “2025.” So, you might need to request grammatical corrections. And remember to use the image size format that your calendar will follow.

![DALL-E 3 Calendar Cover](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-calendar.jpeg)

## 3  A Birthday Card Cover

 Will a loved one be celebrating their special day soon? Consider using AI to generate the image for a birthday card cover. I entered the following prompt:

> “Please create a birthday card for an 18th birthday. The card cover should be in 1600 x 800 format, and it's for someone who's interested in aviation. I want the colors to be somewhat bright, but not over the top.”

 This was the result:

![DALL-E 3 Birthday Card Prototype With Typos Etc.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-birthday-card-prototype.jpeg)

 As you can see, DALL-E 3 gave me a birthday card cover. However, it also added other objects that I didn’t want—such as a background and stencils. There were also spelling inaccuracies.

 So, I tried the following prompt instead:

> “Please recreate this with ONLY the birthday card cover taking up the screen. I don’t want the stencils, etc.”

 Okay, so that didn’t go to plan…

![DALL-E 3 Birthday Card Error in Text and Design](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-birthday-card-error.jpeg)

 You have to be very specific with your prompts. I was relatively happy with the final result (below), but my prior prompts were perhaps too vague. I did, however, explicitly tell DALL-E 3 to correct the spelling.

![DALL-E 3 Birthday Card Cover](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-birthday-card.jpeg)

## 4  Desktop Wallpapers

 You can [create a desktop background using AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-desktop-background-using-ai/) in many ways, including with DALL-E 3\. This prompt is very simple. All I asked was the following:

> “Create a watercolor desktop wallpaper that depicts Big Ben in London, UK.”

 Below is the result, which I’m happy with. You may need to get more specific, such as asking DALL-E 3 to remove the white background.

![A Desktop Background Created in DALL-E 3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-desktop-background.jpeg)

## 5  Smartphone Wallpapers

 If you want a unique smartphone wallpaper, you can experiment with DALL-E 3 and see what it comes up with. I first asked DALL-E 3 to give me a smartphone wallpaper in 16:9 format, but despite asking multiple times, the AI did not remove the images of an actual smartphone (see the first and second images at the bottom of this section).

 So, I tried a different prompt:

> “Give me a 16:9 image of a fjord in Norway.”

 This prompt gave me what I needed, as you can see from the third picture in the gallery below.

## 6  Music Album Covers

 You can find several [websites to sell your own music](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/great-sites-to-sell-your-own-music-on/), and a visually appealing album cover is paramount to standing out and getting recognized.

 Like the smartphone wallpapers, DALL-E 3 had issues understanding that I didn’t want the album cover background. So, I instead asked it:

> “Give me a square format image that an electronic artist could use.”

 The result was more of what I wanted. If you need album artwork, ask DALL-E 3 without mentioning that you’ll use it for an album cover. Otherwise, you’ll go around in circles with the AI bot for a while.

![DALL-E 3 AI Art Cover in Square Format](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-ai-art-cover.jpeg)

## 7  Social Media Cover Banners

 If you’re looking for a new cover image or banner for your social media profile, try asking DALL-E 3 to create something artistic. The best option is to ask if the program can create a banner in the sizes you need.

 I used the following prompt:

> “Create an artistic 1500 x 750 banner of the Nyhavn canal in Copenhagen, Denmark”

 You can customize the above prompt for any landmark or genre that interests you. Below is the result I got with just one prompt. I was happy with this, and it was a much smoother process than some of the other attempts in this article.

![A social media banner image generated with DALL-E 3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-social-media-banner.jpeg)

## 8  Photo Album Covers

 Do you want to print photos you took on a recent trip? If so, why not also customize the photo album cover? You can also create physical photo album covers for other things, like images of your dogs and family.

 Below is a prompt I tried for a photo album cover:

> “Give me a street scene of Paris, France, on a rainy day. Include the French flag somewhere.”

 After a few more prompts to change the orientation and adjust the French flag, I received the below result—which I was quite happy with.

![DALL-E 3 Photo Album Cover Image of a Street Scene](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dall-e-3-photo-album-cover-image.jpeg)

 You can ask DALL-E 3 to remove text, alter colors, and various other things if you want these. If you want to design a picture book, consider checking out this guide on [how to make your own photo book](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-photo-book-guide/).

 DALL-E 3 is a simple tool that can help you create images for all kinds of projects, but you need to be specific with your prompts. If you aren’t, you may end up with less-than-desirable results. If you want to design covers for albums and books, it’s a good idea not to tell the AI that you’ll use them for these purposes. If you do, it might give you prototypes instead.

 Learn how to create better AI-generated images in DALL-E 3 with this tried-and-tested list of prompts. You can use these prompts in numerous scenarios and play around with your own ideas and variations for optimal results. Let’s walk through the examples I’ve created.

## 1  A Poster of Your Favorite Place

 There are many [websites to find unique art for your home](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-sites-find-unique-art/), but creating one in DALL-E3 is easier and more personal. One prompt you can try is asking the platform to generate a poster of your favorite place.

 I started by asking DALL-E 3 to generate a poster of the New York City skyline at dusk. While happy with the initial artwork, I wanted to adjust the format. So, I simply asked:

> “Please recreate this in 1200 x 600 format”

 And here is the final result:

## 2  Calendar Cover Artwork

 You can [make a printable calendar with Canva](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/make-your-own-calendar-using-canva/) and other apps, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use DALL-E 3 to generate the front cover artwork. Whether you want to gift someone your calendar or use it yourself, try using this prompt.

 I asked DALL-E 3:

> “Generate calendar cover artwork for a 2025 calendar that’ll feature artistic images of Alaska’s landscapes”

 When I asked DALL-E 3 the first time around, it gave me “20225” instead of “2025.” So, you might need to request grammatical corrections. And remember to use the image size format that your calendar will follow.

## 3  A Birthday Card Cover

 Will a loved one be celebrating their special day soon? Consider using AI to generate the image for a birthday card cover. I entered the following prompt:

> “Please create a birthday card for an 18th birthday. The card cover should be in 1600 x 800 format, and it's for someone who's interested in aviation. I want the colors to be somewhat bright, but not over the top.”

 This was the result:

 As you can see, DALL-E 3 gave me a birthday card cover. However, it also added other objects that I didn’t want—such as a background and stencils. There were also spelling inaccuracies.

 So, I tried the following prompt instead:

> “Please recreate this with ONLY the birthday card cover taking up the screen. I don’t want the stencils, etc.”

 Okay, so that didn’t go to plan…

 You have to be very specific with your prompts. I was relatively happy with the final result (below), but my prior prompts were perhaps too vague. I did, however, explicitly tell DALL-E 3 to correct the spelling.

## 4  Desktop Wallpapers

 You can [create a desktop background using AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-desktop-background-using-ai/) in many ways, including with DALL-E 3\. This prompt is very simple. All I asked was the following:

> “Create a watercolor desktop wallpaper that depicts Big Ben in London, UK.”

 Below is the result, which I’m happy with. You may need to get more specific, such as asking DALL-E 3 to remove the white background.

## 5  Smartphone Wallpapers

 If you want a unique smartphone wallpaper, you can experiment with DALL-E 3 and see what it comes up with. I first asked DALL-E 3 to give me a smartphone wallpaper in 16:9 format, but despite asking multiple times, the AI did not remove the images of an actual smartphone (see the first and second images at the bottom of this section).

 So, I tried a different prompt:

> “Give me a 16:9 image of a fjord in Norway.”

 This prompt gave me what I needed, as you can see from the third picture in the gallery below.

## 6  Music Album Covers

 You can find several [websites to sell your own music](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/great-sites-to-sell-your-own-music-on/), and a visually appealing album cover is paramount to standing out and getting recognized.

 Like the smartphone wallpapers, DALL-E 3 had issues understanding that I didn’t want the album cover background. So, I instead asked it:

> “Give me a square format image that an electronic artist could use.”

 The result was more of what I wanted. If you need album artwork, ask DALL-E 3 without mentioning that you’ll use it for an album cover. Otherwise, you’ll go around in circles with the AI bot for a while.

## 7  Social Media Cover Banners

 If you’re looking for a new cover image or banner for your social media profile, try asking DALL-E 3 to create something artistic. The best option is to ask if the program can create a banner in the sizes you need.

 I used the following prompt:

> “Create an artistic 1500 x 750 banner of the Nyhavn canal in Copenhagen, Denmark”

 You can customize the above prompt for any landmark or genre that interests you. Below is the result I got with just one prompt. I was happy with this, and it was a much smoother process than some of the other attempts in this article.

## 8  Photo Album Covers

 Do you want to print photos you took on a recent trip? If so, why not also customize the photo album cover? You can also create physical photo album covers for other things, like images of your dogs and family.

 Below is a prompt I tried for a photo album cover:

> “Give me a street scene of Paris, France, on a rainy day. Include the French flag somewhere.”

 After a few more prompts to change the orientation and adjust the French flag, I received the below result—which I was quite happy with.

 You can ask DALL-E 3 to remove text, alter colors, and various other things if you want these. If you want to design a picture book, consider checking out this guide on [how to make your own photo book](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-photo-book-guide/).
