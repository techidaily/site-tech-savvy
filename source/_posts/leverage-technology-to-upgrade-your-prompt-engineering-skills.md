## Leverage Technology to Upgrade Your Prompt Engineering Skills

 Prompt engineering is easy to learn but hard to master. You might have trouble achieving your desired output as you execute complex, multi-step projects. AI won’t do what you want unless you explicitly explain your instructions and convey your message.

 With that said, not all prompts must come from your imagination. Here are seven tools that will help you learn about various AI platforms, write effective prompts, and become a proficient prompt engineer.

## 1\. OpenAI Playground

![Generating Results on OpenAI Playground Different GPT-3 Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/openai-playground-gpt-models.jpg)

 Avoid recycling prompts when testing multiple AI systems. Since they use different language models and datasets, they might not yield the same results. Blindly copy-pasting prompts will only cause inconsistencies.

 To understand how AI models react, try your prompts on OpenAI Playground. It’s a customizable AI bot. Unlike the more popular ChatGPT, it lets you adjust the key parameters that affect output generation, including:

* **GPT Model:** You can [test different GPT-3 models on the OpenAI Playground](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt-3-openai-playground/), e.g., Davinci, Ada, Babbage, and Curie.
* **Temperature:** This parameter dictates the randomness of the AI model's output. Systems with low temperatures are less likely to sample multiple sources. You’ll get the exact, fine-tuned output even if you regenerate responses several times.
* **Stop Sequences:** AI stops generating tokens once it hits your predetermined stop sequences. Open-ended instructions produce lengthy outputs.

## 2\. Playground AI

 Although Midjourney is a reliable text-to-image generator, it’s quite pricey. Aspiring prompt engineers might not want to buy tools they’ll rarely use.

 If you’re just studying AI art, try Playground AI. The platform lets you generate 1,000 images with Stable Diffusion 1.5, Stable Diffusion 2.1, and Playground V1 daily. You can also adjust output parameters, e.g., prompt guidance and seed.

 Playground AI is in no way related to the OpenAI Playground. Please don’t confuse the two.

## 3\. GPTtools

 While OpenAI Playground lets you test different GPT-3 models, it has a plain interface. Scrolling up and down makes data comparison challenging. Reading more than three outputs wastes much time because they’re listed vertically.

 For easy results analyses, try Comparison Tool by GPTtools. Like OpenAI Playground, it lets you adjust the key parameters of output generation, e.g., GPT-3 models, stop sequence, and temperature. You can also select sample inputs.

 The difference between the two is that Comparison Tool lets you review multiple outputs side by side. It’s a small change. However, you’ll find it very useful when analyzing dozens of responses. The platform even lets you turn them into Excel sheets.

 Since lengthy reports might take days to track, organize them properly. [Create an OpenAI account](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-api-guide-what-can-you-do/), generate API keys, and sort them according to their project types.

## 4\. PromptBase

 AI has significantly advanced over the past years, but the industry is still evolving. Global tech leaders have just started releasing AI-driven tools. Aspiring prompt engineers might not find many openings yet, especially among smaller tech startups.

 To make extra money writing prompts, sign up for PromptBase. It’s one of the most established prompt marketplaces online—you’ll find hundreds of thousands of paid prompts. You can start selling after making an account.

 Midjourney and ChatGPT prompts often sell well, but don’t limit yourself to these platforms. Explore niche, less competitive markets. PromptBase accommodates a wide range of language models, including GPT, Dall-E, and Stable Diffusion.

 Also, sell prompts that solve problems. Identify what AI users commonly complain about, create ways to overcome these roadblocks, then market the prompts online.

## 5\. GitHub

 Anyone interested in AI needs a GitHub account. It features a massive database of LLMs, programming, coding, and prompt engineering resources. You’ll find infinite repositories discussing these topics.

 You can expand your knowledge of AI by studying various resources, but you could also focus on writing prompts. In fact, there are several [unique, effective ChatGPT prompts on GitHub](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-chatgpt-prompts-on-github/). Search whatever task you want—you’ll likely find a few formulas showing you how to execute it.

 To further improve your skills, collaborate with other users. Free accounts get about 2,000 minutes of Actions and 120 core hours of Codespaces a month. Play around with the site a bit. You can consider upgrading to a Pro account as you take on bigger projects.

## 6\. Find Anything

![Searching for Dog Pictures on Google With Find Anything Extension](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/find-anything-extension-on-google-images.jpg)

[Text-to-image generators](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/) help you visualize concepts, but their output doesn’t follow standard copyright laws. You can’t [claim ownership of AI-generated art](https://www.makeuseof.com/copyright-rules-ai-art/). AI tools pull elements from existing content, many of which might be copyright-protected.

 But unlike most image generators, the Find Anything app claims that it provides copyright-free images. You can supposedly use their output for commercial and editorial purposes. Just pin the extension, and it will add AI images to your Google image search.

 Despite its claims, you should still give attribution to Find Anything. There’s no guarantee it provides copyright-free images, so play it safe by retaining your photo credits.

 Or better yet, solely use Find Anything for art inspiration. Running it requires less technical know-how than Midjourney—beginners can practice testing text-to-image prompts here.

## 7\. Eye for AI

![Generating Skull and Flower Image on EyeforAi Image Generator](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/eyeforai-image-generator.jpg)

 If you need an affordable Midjourney alternative, try Eye for AI. It uses the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model by default, and you can start generating images right from the get-go. Just input your text prompts. You could also select helpful descriptors to improve output accuracy.

 Although convenient, we discourage running text-to-image prompts on Eye for AI’s default settings. Otherwise, you’ll generate distorted, inaccurate images. Train the platform yourself to maximize its full potential.

 Upload relevant images of the person or object you want to portray—make sure you show the subject from various angles. And if possible, set your preferred diffusion model. Free accounts get 24 credits. You can purchase an extra 300 credits for just $13 if you find the Eye for AI useful.

 Please use AI image generators responsibly. Creating deepfakes to spread misinformation and damage a person’s reputation has legal consequences.

## Write Better Prompts With the Right Tools

 Prompt engineering is an art and a science. Good communication skills help you convey vague, ambiguous ideas clearly, but you can’t solely rely on them. Coming up with great prompt ideas takes time. If you hit a creative block, keep the process going by studying language models, reading other prompts, and testing various AI platforms.

 We also suggest exploring other prompt engineering resources. With global tech leaders adopting language models, the demand for efficient, unique prompts will only increase. Start learning how to communicate with AI.
