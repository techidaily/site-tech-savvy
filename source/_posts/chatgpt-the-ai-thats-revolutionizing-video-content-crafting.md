## ChatGPT: The AI That's Revolutionizing Video Content Crafting

 ChatGPT has the capability to do so many creative things. You can use it as an idea generator, a story writer, and even a proofreader. But what about using it to create scripts for your next YouTube video?

 Sure, ChatGPT has that ability as well. However, it’s important to understand that without the proper information, the AI won’t be able to create the most effective script. This means you need to work with the software.

 Below is a guide on how to collaborate with ChatGPT to create an effective and engaging YouTube script.

## Why Use ChatGPT to Help You Write a Script?

![Man on laptop with ChatGPT open](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/man-on-laptop-with-chatgpt-open.jpg)

[There are several ways that ChatGPT can help YouTubers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-can-help-content-creators/)—script writing is just one of them. Enlisting the AI to help you write a script will assist in alleviating time and stress, giving you the ability to hit that record button sooner than you thought possible.

[Writing an engaging script for a YouTube video](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-write-youtube-video-script/) is incredibly important. Though ChatGPT can’t express emotion, it can give you pointers and examples for how to turn your script from mundane to appealing.

 Additionally, ChatGPT works great as a research assistant. If you need a script that requires facts about a town or the answers to any hard-hitting questions, ChatGPT can gather them up in seconds.

 Lastly, you don’t want to run into grammatical errors while you’re following along with the script when you’re recording—you’ll find yourself fumbling a lot, which will lead to more editing time later. [ChatGPT works great as a proofreader](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/). Just make sure to tell it what you want it to look for, like grammar, punctuation, or tenses.

## How to Use ChatGPT to Write a YouTube Script

 When you use ChatGPT to write a YouTube script, you can’t simply expect the AI to create something that will go along with your niche. You have to learn to work together with ChatGPT to receive the best results possible.

### 1\. Set the Premise

 The first thing you are going to want to do is explain to ChatGPT exactly what you need from it. Simply saying you need a script about what to look for in a suitable off-grid campsite in the backwoods of Colorado isn’t enough.

 For example, you may only want your video to be five minutes long. You may also want there to be room for both verbal explanation and some silences to help give room to [use b-roll footage to visually enhance your YouTube video](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-shoot-b-roll-footage/).

 By letting ChatGPT know the requirements of the script from the beginning, you won’t have to narrow down a 20-minute script or remove a lot of verbiage to make room for other things.

![Establishing the premise with ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/establishing-the-premise-with-chatgpt.jpeg)

 Just make sure that before pressing send, you let the AI know not to start spitting out a script yet. You just want to make sure it understands the overall assignment before giving it more details about the interworkings of the script.

![ChatGPT's answer for establishing the premise of writing a script](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-s-answer-for-establishing-the-premise.jpeg)

### 2\. Give as Much Information as Possible

 Without giving ChatGPT the proper information that you need for your video, it will spit out a random script that may not make sense for your channel. If you’re already thinking about a video, though, chances are you have some ideas of what you want in the script.

![Explaining what should be in the script to ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/explaining-what-should-be-in-the-script-to-chatgpt.jpeg)

 For the example above, the video needs to explain that the site should be accessible by vehicle or hike, near running water, in a remote location, on public land, and on suitable terrain. Letting ChapGPT know these script requirements will help you not have to do so much editing later.

### 3\. Review the First Draft

 After ChatGPT gives you your first draft, make sure to review it. It may be set up in a way that doesn’t flow with your style of videos, or the information isn’t explained very well.

![ChatGPT's first draft of YouTube script](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chatgpt-s-first-draft-of-youtube-script.jpeg)

 In the example, ChatGPT did add timing for the introductions for each section. For the purpose of the video, the timing is a bit long, but that can be easily ignored. However, in the public land section, there should be more information regarding the rules.

### 4\. Customize to Your Preferences

 After reviewing the first draft, let ChatGPT know what areas need to be fixed. Keep communicating with the AI until you are satisfied with the results of your script.

![ChatGPT adding publish land rules to script](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/adding-publish-land-rules-to-script.jpeg)

 It may take a couple of times for ChatGPT to get it right, though. However, if you give ChatGPT enough information from the beginning, there shouldn’t be too much editing and customization that has to be done.

## ChatGPT YouTube Script Observations

 ChatGPT did a well enough job of piecing together a short script. It added segments for b-roll and explained when the narrator should be in front of the camera and when there should be a voice-over instead.

 Additionally, each point that was originally requested received its own section with guidance on what kind of shots should be taken while the voice-over explained the key points, which ChatGPT gave as well.

 There are areas that do need a more innovative touch—but in the end, you are the creator. It’s completely up to you what parts of the script should be changed to fit the voice of your channel and help entice your viewers to watch your videos.

### 1\. Use ChatGPT as an Assistant, Not a Replacement

 When it comes to creating YouTube scripts, or anything else concerning YouTube or other social media platforms, you are the original creator. This means that you need to be the one doing the work and having the final say.

 ChatGPT’s intent is to be an assistant—it’s supposed to guide you in making your scripts. Sure, you can ask it for a rough draft, but you can’t take what it gives you at face value. Make sure to proofread and add personal touches to ensure the script is right for your viewing audience and your channel.

### 2\. Be Aware of Outdated Information

 ChatGPT does make mistakes. It’s important to stay aware of the fact that as of September 2023, ChatGPT’s knowledge cutoff day is September 2021\. This means that if your script needs facts from after that time period, you are going to need to do the research to make sure the information is accurate.

### 3\. Stay Creatively Open-minded

 As a creator, you may go head first into a project thinking that you know exactly what you want. However, it’s important to always keep an open mind. Remember, you’re using ChatGPT as an assistant, so why not consider some of the ideas that it comes up with?

 Not only will you find the opportunity to open yourself up to more creative styles to work with, but you may also find a new way of expressing yourself on camera. Working with ChatGPT is the same as working in a group dynamic. It’s wise to take other opinions into consideration.
