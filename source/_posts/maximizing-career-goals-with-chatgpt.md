[Generative AI is changing the job market](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-change-job-market/) in many ways, but one especially useful function is helping you to filter job openings by industry, job title, and location preferences. This helps save time and effort by limiting your search to only positions that meet your criteria. It can also provide more details about the employment offered, including the required qualifications and duties.

 ChatGPT can also assist you in creating a targeted resume by suggesting keywords and phrases to include based on the job description. You may also request that ChatGPT analyze your existing resume and give you feedback and pointers on improving it.

 Are you just starting a job search on your own for the first time? Finding profiles of companies in a particular industry can be more challenging when you're new to the process. Additionally, you will need to do further research on these companies and examine their careers page.

 ChatGPT can help you with the initial basics. This includes finding and researching employers who are looking for candidates in your areas of expertise. While it can't give you as much detail as you would find on the employer sites, it can definitely guide you on where to start looking.
