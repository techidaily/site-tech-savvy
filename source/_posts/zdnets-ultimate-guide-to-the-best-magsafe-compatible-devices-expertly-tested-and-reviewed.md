## Apple iPad Mini 6th Generation

### Best small tablet overall

Apple's iPad Mini is our top pick for the best small tablet thanks to its A15 Bionic chip, which makes it a powerful tablet packed into a small package. The iPad Mini was last updated in the fall of 2021 with new features like support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, a slightly bigger screen size, and a USB-C port for charging and data transfer.

There's a spot on the right side of the tablet to charge the Apple Pencil, making it a great tablet for drawing or writing notes. Customers who bought the iPad Mini reported in reviews that they were impressed by its battery life, durability, and display. They also noted its portability to fit in purses and bags, particularly for entertainment purposes. 

**Review:** [**Apple iPad Mini (6th Gen.)**](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-6th-generation-tablet-64-gb-8-3-mk7p3lla/)

ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner tested the iPad Mini and said that it "feels more like an \[oversized\] smartphone than a small tablet at times."

"It can easily slip into bags, purses, and even the pockets of some cargo pants and vests," he wrote. "Compared to a phone, it's better for reading ebooks, PDFs, documents, news apps, and other digital content -- especially when leaning back in a chair or a couch."

Of course, you'll also get iPadOS 16 with features like shared tab groups, Stage Manager, and external display support if you ever need to see something on a bigger screen. Ultimately, you get all these things for less than what you would pay for an iPad Air or an iPad Pro. 

**iPad Mini tech specs: Display**: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display | **Processor**: A15 Bionic | **Storage**: 64GB or 256GB | **Colors**: Space gray, pink, purple, starlight | **Cameras**: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | **Weight**: 0.65 pounds | **Dimensions**: 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.25 inches | **Connections**: USB-C | **Battery life:** 10 hours

## Amazon Fire 7 Tablet

### Best budget small tablet

If you're looking for something even smaller and cheaper than the iPad Mini, the Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great budget tablet pick. The Fire tablet's 7-inch screen has a 1024 x 600 display, so you can stream movies or play video games without hauling around a bulky tablet. 

Former ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani reviewed the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and said it offers "a well-rounded experience as long as you take the cost into account when setting expectations." Even though performance may be a bit slow, Cipriani said that's expected at a price point like $60, considering the tablet is a colorful Kindle, a dedicated Alexa smart display, and a smart home controller, all in one device.

**Review:** [**Amazon Fire 7 (2022)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-fire-7-2022-review/)

Along with the ability to ask Alexa questions, you can view and manage your Alexa-connected smart home devices. You can control cameras, lights, and outlets using your voice or by tapping the dedicated Devices button in the bottom navigation bar. 

Overall, 90% of Best Buy customers who bought the Amazon Fire 7 tablet would recommend it to a friend, giving it an average rating of 4.5 out of 5.

**Amazon Fire 7 tech specs: Display**: 7-inch, 1024x600 display | **Processor**: MediaTek MT8168V/B | **Storage**: 16GB or 326GB | **Colors**: Black, denim, or rose | **Cameras**: 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording| **Weight**: 9.9 ounces | **Dimensions**: 7.11 x 4.63 x 0.38 inches | **Connections**: 2 USB-C, 3.5mm jack | **Battery life:** 10 hours

### Best small tablet for note-taking

Boox is an e-reader and drawing tablet with a vivid color display, so your e-book's illustrations will pop as you read, and so will your color-coordinated notes. Speaking of which, the note-taking templates on the Tab Mini C are handy. Whether you're a student taking Cornell-style notes, a desk job employee making an hourly plan for your day, a musician crafting a piece of sheet music, or a historian drafting a timeline, the Tab Mini C offers a template for that. 

Another fun feature is the tablet's four customizable refresh modes. These modes are helpful for streaming videos on YouTube and needing a smoother display or for e-reading and not minding a clunkier refresh. With adjustable warm and cool lights, you can customize your desired blue light level to tone the display before bedtime for an easier-on-the-eyes reading experience. 

ZDNET editor Nina Raemont, who contributed to this article, has been using the tablet to manage her work-life calendar, build lists for grocery shopping, meeting agendas, and more. It's become Raemont's deskside companion and staple note-taking device. Because of its lightweight and effortless portability, it has replaced the trusty Moleskin notebook she avidly used to plan her day. 

The robust battery life lasts many days to a week or two, and the tablet comes with a magnetically attached stylus with pressure detection for drawing. The tablet's sleek design has a minimalist feel and careful use of popping colors. However, [Reddit users note](https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/16imqez/is%5Fthe%5Fboox%5Ftab%5Fmini%5Fc%5Fthe%5Fbest%5Fhandwriting/) that you may have to tinker with the tablet's settings to maximize your experience. 

**Boox Tab Mini C specs: Display**: 7.9-inch screen, electronic ink | **Processor**: Advanced Octa-core | **Storage**: 64GB | **Colors**: Black| **Cameras**: None | **Weight**: 11 ounces | **Dimensions**: 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.33 inches | **Connections**: USB-C | **Battery:** 5,000mAh Li-ion Polymer

### Best small tablet for reading

The upgraded 11th-generation Kindle offers 16GB of storage instead of 8GB, 300ppi instead of 167ppi, six weeks of battery life instead of four weeks, and charging via USB-C instead of micro-USB. 

The new Kindle is the smallest and lightest of the models, which verified Amazon customers note was one of the main reasons they bought this small tablet. The previous generation weighed 6.1 ounces, but this new one weighs only 5.56 ounces, and it's drastically easier to carry and hold than an actual book (especially those thick hardcovers). 

**Review:** [**Amazon Kindle (11th generation)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-new-kindle-has-officially-converted-me-to-e-readers/)

Its 300ppi display is the same as that of the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Oasis. The anti-glare display makes it easy to read in any light, and dark mode is a warm welcome when you're trying to read at night without letting blue light interrupt your sleep cycle. 

I went hands-on with this Kindle and was impressed by the quickly loading pages, the exceptional backlight, and the long-lasting battery life, which was at about 70% after one week of frequent use. I almost exclusively read on my Kindle and have retired my hardcover book habit. 

**Amazon Kindle tech specs: Display:** 6-inch, 300ppi glare-free | **Storage:** 16GB | **Colors:** Black or denim | **Weight:** 5.56 ounces | **Dimensions:** 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches | **Connections:** USB-C | **Battery**: Up to six weeks

The lightweight design and small display make the Tab A7 Lite portable enough to take anywhere, especially if you're using it to entertain kids with educational apps. Plus, the metal frame adds some added ruggedness.

In addition, you can expand your storage beyond the 32GB or 64GB allotted. The tablet allows up to 1TB of expandable storage, twice as much as the previous model. Overall, 91% of Best Buy customers would recommend buying this tablet, giving it an average rating of 4.5 out of 5.

## Factors to consider when choosing the best small tablets:

We know there are a lot of tablets and tablet sizes to choose from, but ultimately, these were the determining factors in our top picks. 

* **Size:** We paid attention to tablets between six and eight inches, which defines a tablet as small. We also looked at a tablet's weight to ensure they were portable.
* **Display:** Small tablets shouldn't have to compromise on an already smaller display, so we also considered display resolution.
* **Battery life:** A device's battery life is important no matter its size, so we considered devices that can last you all day.
* **Price:** Tablets vary in price range from affordable to expensive depending on brand and purpose, so we made sure to choose tablets at various price points to accommodate different budgets.

## How we test tablets

The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when [tested in the real world](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/). When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.

* **Display**: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.  
We also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.
* **Performance:** For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.
* **Battery life**: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.
* **Camera and audio:** For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.

## What is the smallest tablet screen size?

The smallest tablet screen size on the market is 6 to 7 inches. Anything smaller would be more similar to a smartphone.

It's why you want to consider your primary uses when considering which small tablet is right for you. To demonstrate, if you travel often, one with a smaller screen will be perfect for carrying/using on an airplane. If your aim is to read more e-books or draw, you'll want one with a larger screen.

## What brand of tablet is best?

Tablets made by Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft are the best-made tablets in terms of quality. Amazon has well-rounded tablets in its Fire lineup but with fewer performance-focused features. Boox is also proving to be an industry underdog, with impressive tablets that function as e-readers and illustrators. 

Keep in mind in certain cases (Apple, Samsung), you can pair your other devices with the tablet. In the case of Apple tablets, you can log in using your Apple ID to access the same apps, pictures, and more from your phone on your iPad. 

Meanwhile, with Samsung devices, you can implement Samsung Flow. Download the app on your phone and tablet. You can connect your tablet to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. 

## Are mini Android tablets worth it?

Yes, they can be. Small Android tablets allow you to do everything you would normally do, like reading e-books and video calling, without the higher price tags. 

Their lightweight body and compact design make them perfect traveling companions. So, if you're searching for the best Android tablet with great battery life and lightweight design, the minis are an enticing choice.
