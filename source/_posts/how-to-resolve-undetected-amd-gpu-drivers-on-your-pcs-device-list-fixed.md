## Immediate Fixes for the 'Camera Not Found' Issue on Your PC – Guide Updated

Have you ever found yourself in a frustrating situation where your camera is not working on your computer? You may instinctively try reinstalling the camera driver, only to find the camera is missing from Device Manager entirely. If so, don’t worry – you’re not alone. In this post, I’ll walk you through some**effective fixes to get your camera back in Device Manager** in no time. Let’s dig in and fix that missing camera problem for good.

## Where is your webcam in Device Manager?

 If you can’t find your webcam in Device Manager, you can check the following groups to see if it’s listed elsewhere:

* **Cameras**
* **Imaging devices**
* **USB devices/ USB device hub**

 Have you found your camera in these device groups? If not, you can try the workarounds below to fix this issue.

## Try these fixes

1. **[Allow your device to access your camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Scan for hardware changes](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Add a legacy camera driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Run the hardware troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Repair your system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 The screenshots below have been mostly taken from a Windows 10 operating system. If you are using Windows 11, please be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

## Fix 1\. Allow your device to access your camera

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and type **camera privacy settings** .
2. Select **Camera privacy settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/win-11-camera-privacy-settings.jpg)
3. Make sure the option**Camera access** is turned on. If you don’t see it’s on, you can click the**Change** button to turn it on. Then you may want to go back to Device Manager, and check if the camera is there.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/camera-access-on-win-11.jpg)
4. But if the camera is turned on but you still can’t find the camera in Device Manager, you can skip to the next fix below to solve your problem.

## Fix 2\. Scan for hardware changes

 It’s possible that your computer already has the driver installed but the Windows system fails to detect the driver. Therefore, you can scan for hardware changes in Device Manager:

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Select**Cameras** (or Imaging devices/ USB devices) and click**Action** \>**Scan for hardware changes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/scan.jpg)
3. If your webcam shows up, this means the driver has been successfully detected. Restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If scanning for hardware changes didn’t do the trick for you, you can try the next fix below.

## Fix 3\. Update your device drivers

 The first thing is to make sure all your device drivers are up to date. Since you can’t update the driver right from the Device Manager ([learn why you can’t rely on Windows…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website and install the latest webcam drivers (along with other device drivers).

### Option 1 – Manually

Let’s take Dell computers for an example:

1. Go to the[Dell Support](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fen-us%3Fapp%3Dproducts) page. Then enter your product model to get all the related drivers in**Drivers & Downloads** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Delldownload-1.jpg)
2. Download the driver you need and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/driver.jpg)

 Of course, you can use their **[SupportAssist](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fcontents%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Fproduct-support%2Fself-support-knowledgebase%2Fsoftware-and-downloads%2Fsupportassist)**  to get the latest drivers and fix hardware issues, but this software can take up a lot of CPU, thus slowing down your PC.

4. Select **Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)** . Then click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/next.jpg)
5. Choose**Cameras** and click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/camera-driver.jpg)
6. If a webcam driver is listed here, you can select the device and click**Next** . (You can select**Have Disk** if you have downloaded a driver for your webcam.)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
7. If there’s no device selected, you can go back to the last window, and select**Imaging devices** \>**Next** .
8. Select a device from the list and click**Next** .

 Once you have successfully added a device, you can restart your computer for this to take effect.

## Fix 6\. Run the System File Checker

 In case some system files related to your camera get corrupted, you can try restoring the file using one of the following methods:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/camera-missing-in-device-manager/#reimage)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of the camera missing in Device Manager. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* **[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fortectstartrepair.png)

### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your personal data.

#### Step 1\. Scan corrupt files with System File Checker

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-cmd.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt, type the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

![Windows 11 - System File Checker](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-sfc-scannow.jpg)

 3) System File Check will begin to scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

 4) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what message you receive, you can try running**dism.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to further scan the health of your PC.

#### Step 2\. Run dism.exe

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you may get some error messages.

* If restore heath gave you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 If the System File Check finds any files corrupted, follow the on-screen instructions to repair them, and then restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.
