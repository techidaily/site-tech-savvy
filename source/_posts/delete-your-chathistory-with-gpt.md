 Before you delete your ChatGPT account, there are a few things you should do first.

### 1\. Export Your Data

 ChatGPT gives you the option to export your account data. This includes your profile information, conversations, and prompts. [Export your ChatGPT data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-export-chatgpt-data/) before deleting your account, just in case you want to use it again or access some conversations later.

### 2\. Save Your Favorite Prompts

 If you have any favorite ChatGPT prompts, save them before deleting your account. You can easily save these prompts by copying and pasting them into a document.

### 3\. Review Your Subscription

 If you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you may need to cancel your subscription separately from deleting your account. Reviewing your subscription will help ensure you do not incur any unexpected charges.

## Try an Alternative Service to ChatGPT

 Deleting your ChatGPT account can be a permanent solution if you're done with the service. However, if you wouldn't mind an alternative, you may want to check out similar services. ChatGPT is a great tool, but there are other options that provide matching features and services.
