## Redefining Patient Engagement Through ChatGPT Innovation

 AI and language models are paving the way for a healthcare revolution, and ChatGPT is at the forefront of it all. However, the big question remains: can ChatGPT truly make a difference in patient care and treatments?

## What Is the Role of ChatGPT in Public Health?

 NLP (Natural Language Processing) is not a brand-new concept in the healthcare sector. The industry has been using systems similar to—though not as user-friendly as—ChatGPT for a while to handle the vast amount of data they deal with daily.

 However, NLP systems are used by healthcare professionals, not patients. Medical professionals use these systems, whether custom-made or from third-party providers, for tasks like organizing medical documents and conducting research with data.

 ChatGPT is also an NLP tool, but it's not your ordinary chatbot—it is quite advanced, and various industries have already embraced it to make their work seamless and solve tricky challenges.

 What makes ChatGPT special is that it is simpler, user-friendly, and can have human-like conversations. Although both ChatGPT and existing NLP systems in healthcare are not perfect, they can help meet the growing demands of patient care worldwide. NLP is one of the important [medical technologies shaping healthcare's future](https://www.makeuseof.com/medical-technologies-future-healthcare/).

## How to Use ChatGPT in Healthcare

![chatgpt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonathan-kemper-mmuzs5qzuus-unsplash.jpg)

 Currently, ChatGPT is mainly used in the administrative side of healthcare, and it's proving to be a game-changer for healthcare professionals. It can do many things to make their lives easier, like handling paperwork, checklists, and logs. In a recent survey by [Jackson Healthcare](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/nursing/nurses-say-distractions-cut-bedside-time-25), most nurses admitted spending 25% of their shift on non-patient tasks, and ChatGPT aims to reduce that burden.

### Using ChatGPT to Sort Unstructured Data

 Unstructured data in the medical field includes things like clinical notes, patient feedback, and medical literature. While you can read it, it becomes hard to search once it piles up in hundreds of documents saved by doctors. As a result, you can't get valuable insights from this data, which is crucial for diagnosis and medical care.

 ChatGPT can quickly analyze massive amounts of data—even diagnostics data. Just ask it a specific question with the sorting criteria you need, and it will give you the structured data you are looking for. You can copy its response, save it on a notepad, and open the file in Microsoft Excel to finish the process—problem solved!

### Remote Patient Monitoring With ChatGPT

 Even though doctors can't be with their patients all the time, patients need to keep track of their symptoms. This is where remote patient monitoring comes in. Patients track vital signs—like blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose levels—and share this data with their doctor. The doctor then reviews the information and provides feedback to the patient. It's a way to stay connected and care for patient health even when not in the same place.

 But clinicians receive a lot of vital signs data from patients every single day, which can be overwhelming to examine. Luckily, ChatGPT can analyze the information collected by home health monitoring systems and provide clear insights for both patients and healthcare professionals. All patients have to do is share their results, and ChatGPT will let them know if everything is normal or not. After all, ChatGPT passed the USMLE exam!

### ChatGPT as a Virtual Assistant for Patient Care

 ChatGPT can be like having a personal assistant available all the time for doctors. It can handle client communication, schedule appointments, and even help create emails. Moreover, you can rely on it to summarize clinical notes and the patient's medical history, making your preparation for visits much easier. And with ChatGPT-4's plugin feature, using it has become even simpler. Here's [how you can make the most of ChatGPT plugins](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/).

## ChatGPT Has Potential in Healthcare, But Be Careful

 In the future, ChatGPT might be helpful in patient care and other medical areas. But remember, it doesn't have a medical classification system because it's not specifically designed for healthcare.

 So, it's better to avoid relying on it for crucial healthcare tasks like diagnoses and treatments because it can sometimes make mistakes and give incorrect information.
