 ChatGPT can also be used to generate text. If you need inspiration or want to alternate the tone, you can always ask ChatGPT for its thoughts.

 However, it is less specialized than dedicated AI text generators as ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that is great at doing a lot of different things, such as generating ideas and reiterating information.
