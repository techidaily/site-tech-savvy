## 1\. Open Your ChatGPT Account

![Screenshot of ChatGPT homepage (updated)](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-of-chatgpt-homepage-updated.jpg)

 You can easily create one if you don’t already have an account. Go to the site [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/). Once you’re there, you’ll see a prompt to open your account or sign up. You can create a new account with your choice of email, including connecting it to an existing Gmail account.

 You’ll need access to your mobile phone since you’ll receive a six-digit code sent to your phone via text to confirm your registration. Once you’ve confirmed your registration, you’re ready to get started.

 When you’re in ChatGPT, you’ll see you can stay with the free version, ChatGPT 3.5, or pay for access to ChatGPT 4\. The features of ChatGPT-4 include faster responses and access to beta features like code interpreter, plug-ins, and browsing.

 ChatGPT-4 has a limit of 25 messages every three hours, costing $20 monthly. If you’re wondering what other artificial intelligence options exist besides ChatGPT, you might be interested in learning about [the best alternatives to ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternatives-chatgpt/).

![Screenshot of Custom Instructions for freelance writing cover letter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-of-custom-instructions-for-freelance-writing-cover-letter.jpg)

 Before you ask ChatGPT to write content for you, you need to provide custom instructions to the platform. You do this in the custom instructions; you can access it by clicking on your name.

 There are two sections where you input information about yourself. The first one asks: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses? The second one asks: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

 The first section is where you can tell the platform where you live, what you currently do for work, your goals, and your interests. The second section is where you can talk about the tone and length of ChatGPT’s responses.

 You can change the custom instructions at any time, but it will only affect the answers given after the changes are made. If you’re new to the platform, you may ask: [What is ChatGPT and what can you do with generative AI?](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/ "What Is ChatGPT and What Can You Do With Generative AI?").
