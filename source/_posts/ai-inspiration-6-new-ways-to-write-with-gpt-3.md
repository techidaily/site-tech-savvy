## AI Inspiration: 6 New Ways to Write With GPT-3

 ChatGPT has far-reaching uses for many writing tasks, including informative and academic essays, copywriting, social media posts, and much more. It’s also an excellent resource for playing with poetry, short stories, and even personal essays and memoirs. Here’s how to use ChatGPT as a tool to help energize your creative writing and even overcome writer's block.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

## 1\. Work With Poetic Forms

 When you're studying poetry, it's easy to get a bit overwhelmed by the variety of different poetic forms. Because ChatGPT can generate a poem in just about any form, however, it’s a fun way to play around with common poetic types, and you can endlessly tweak the prompts to create different responses.

 Prompt ChatGPT to “write a villanelle about springtime” or “write a sonnet about going to the movies with your best friend.” The chatbot instantly generates a response.

 Try “write an edgy sonnet about going to the movies with your best friend” for a laugh.

![ChatGPT edgy sonnet example](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-edgy-sonnet-example.jpg)

 It can also generate acrostic poems, or ones in which the first letter of each line spells out a word.

![ChatGPT acrostic poem about caffeine](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-acrostic-poem-about-caffeine.jpg)

 The language bot does appear to struggle with free verse or unrhymed poetry in general (at this time). It appears partial to end rhymes, or at least close rhymes.

## 2\. Find Rhymes

 You can also use the app to find perfect, imperfect, and more varieties of rhymes for different words. It's a playful way to expand your rhyming options for verses.

![ChatGPT long e rhymes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-long-e-rhymes.jpg)

 It's also a helpful tool for finding matches for words that are notoriously difficult to rhyme.

## 3\. Check Poetic Meter

 The app can scan poems for meter and rhythm as well, which is handy if you’re trying to work with a specific metrical form in your own poetry. It can differentiate trochaic tetrameter from iambic pentameter in an instant.

 Simply prompt ChatGPT to scan the poem, then paste in your verses.

 You can ask the bot follow-up questions about the scansion, as well as poetic form.

 This offers a helpful way to study poetry and check your own original verses for form.

## 4\. Generate Story Ideas

 ChatGPT really shines as an idea generator for just about any genre of story. Prompt it to “give me 20 story ideas for a sci-fi tale about space travel and adventure.”

 You'll get a huge list of ideas to spark your creativity.

 Get as specific as you like with the prompts. For instance, ask ChatGPT to “provide 15 ideas for mystery short stories that feature a train, a key, and wintry weather” and watch the ideas flow.

![ChatGPT mystery story ideas](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-mystery-story-ideas.jpg)

 You can also get the app to use specific authors for inspiration, too. For instance, prompt it to “provide 15 story ideas in the style of Hemingway about choosing a new pet” or “provide 12 ideas for love stories in the style of Philip K. Dick.”

![ChatGPT story ideas similar to Hemingway](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-story-ideas-similar-to-hemingway.jpg)

 The app keys in on each author's familiar themes and styles to construct these inspiring (and sometimes a bit bizarre) story ideas.

## 5\. Play With Audience and Tone

 Because you can assign roles to ChatGPT, as well as instruct it to address particular audiences, it’s easy to adjust the tone of your pieces for different readers. This is a fantastic way to learn more about tailoring stories for various audiences.

 For instance, a prompt to “tell a story about bears as though you are a kindergarten teacher addressing a classroom” produces a cute, kid-friendly tale about friendship.

![ChatGPT kid friendly bear story](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-kid-friendly-bear-story.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Meanwhile, a prompt to “tell a literary story about bears for a sophisticated adult audience” produces a much more rugged story.

![ChatGPT literary bear story](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-literary-bear-story.jpg)

 In addition, you can insert your own work into the app and tailor it for different audiences. Use prompts like “adjust this story for an audience of primarily female readers in their 20s” or “tailor this story to fans of mystery fiction.”

 It’s fun to see what changes appear, and it’s an instructive practice in customizing your work for different audiences.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Overcome Writer’s Block

 Use ChatGPT to find the right word, rephrase sentences, and generally overcome some of the common hurdles associated with writer’s block. If you get stuck on one sentence, for instance, then you can prompt the chatbot to rephrase it a number of different ways.

![ChatGPT rephrase sentence](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-rephrase-sentence.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Choose your favorite rendition of the sentence and get back to your piece.

![ChatGPt overcoming writer's block prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-overcoming-writer-s-block-prompt.jpg)

 In addition, you can ask the bot to help with whatever is keeping you from writing, whether that's getting started or taking your story to the next chapter.

![ChatGPT mystery story plot twist ideas](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chatgpt-mystery-story-plot-twist-ideas.jpg)

 In this instance, the chatbot offers some ideas for mystery story plot twists. You can also get more specific and ask it for "unexpected plot twists" or similar prompts.

 In many ways, ChatGPT can help you overcome the biggest hurdle for plenty of writers: the blank page (or screen).

## Caveats About Using ChatGPT for Creative Writing

 Although ChatGPT is an amazing tool with impressive storytelling abilities, it's important to use the chatbot responsibly.

 For starters, don’t submit an AI story as your original work. Tools like [GPTZero can detect AI-generated language](https://www.makeuseof.com/gptzero-detect-ai-generated-text/), and claiming AI content as your own can potentially count as plagiarism (AKA a big taboo for any writer).

 In addition, ownership and [copyright of AI-generated text and other content](https://www.makeuseof.com/who-owns-copyright-to-ai-creations/) can get murky. If you're creating stories or poems for publication, then your best bet is to use ChatGPT for idea generation and perhaps some light editing.

 Also, ChatGPT isn’t infallible, so remember that it may provide incorrect information. Double-check with reputable sources for nonfiction content in particular.

 Lastly, remember that your own memories and experiences can’t be generated by AI, so tap into them for your creative writing. ChatGPT is an excellent tool, but it can’t tell your stories for you.

## Boost Your Creative Writing Skills With ChatGPT

 Whether you're writing fiction, poetry, journal entries, blog posts, or other nonfiction content, ChatGPT offers a wide array of guidance for writers. Dig deeper into poetic forms, find the word that's on the tip of your tongue, and generate endless story ideas with help from the popular AI chatbot. With a little help from ChatGPT, you may never have to stare down a blank screen again.
