## Mastering Your Cover Letter: The ChatGPT Way

 ChatGPT is growing in popularity as artificial intelligence’s go-to for content generation. You probably have seen courses and other programs designed to help you leverage this new platform and are curious about its benefits.

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Access to a platform that can create a cohesive document can be a godsend to people who dislike writing. While ChatGPT can help you increase your efficiency, you still have to review the documents it generates to ensure your cover letter gets noticed.

## 1\. Open Your ChatGPT Account

![Screenshot of ChatGPT homepage (updated)](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-of-chatgpt-homepage-updated.jpg)

 You can easily create one if you don’t already have an account. Go to the site [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/). Once you’re there, you’ll see a prompt to open your account or sign up. You can create a new account with your choice of email, including connecting it to an existing Gmail account.

 You’ll need access to your mobile phone since you’ll receive a six-digit code sent to your phone via text to confirm your registration. Once you’ve confirmed your registration, you’re ready to get started.

 When you’re in ChatGPT, you’ll see you can stay with the free version, ChatGPT 3.5, or pay for access to ChatGPT 4\. The features of ChatGPT-4 include faster responses and access to beta features like code interpreter, plug-ins, and browsing.

 ChatGPT-4 has a limit of 25 messages every three hours, costing $20 monthly. If you’re wondering what other artificial intelligence options exist besides ChatGPT, you might be interested in learning about [the best alternatives to ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternatives-chatgpt/).

## 2\. Enter Your Custom Instructions

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Before you ask ChatGPT to write content for you, you need to provide custom instructions to the platform. You do this in the custom instructions; you can access it by clicking on your name.

 There are two sections where you input information about yourself. The first one asks: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses? The second one asks: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

 The first section is where you can tell the platform where you live, what you currently do for work, your goals, and your interests. The second section is where you can talk about the tone and length of ChatGPT’s responses.

 You can change the custom instructions at any time, but it will only affect the answers given after the changes are made. If you’re new to the platform, you may ask: [What is ChatGPT and what can you do with generative AI?](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/ "What Is ChatGPT and What Can You Do With Generative AI?"). We recommend checking out that guide if you're not too sure.

## 3\. Submit a Job Description

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Once you’ve completed your custom instructions, it’s time to provide a job description that ChatGPT can refer to when creating your cover letter. Remember, the key to writing an effective cover letter is addressing all the critical needs indicated in the job description.

 If you’re using the free ChatGPT 3.5 version of the platform, there’s no limit to the number of jobs you can ask it to write cover letters for! You can also ask the platform to regenerate the response if you don’t like the first one you get.

 You may be wondering what ChatGPT means for the future of writers and if it means enormous unemployment lines are in your future. You might find some comfort in learning the [reasons why ChatGPT won’t take your writing job](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-chatgpt-wont-take-writing-job/ "5 Reasons Why ChatGPT Won’t Take Your Writing Job").

## 4\. Prompt ChatGPT to Write the Elements of Your Cover Letter

 Once you’ve submitted the job description, the next step is to ask for a cover letter. Instead of asking it to write one document, you can ask it to focus on each part of your cover letter to create a more focused one.

### The Introductory Paragraph
