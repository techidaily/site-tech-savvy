## Pioneering Intelligence: GPT-4 Elevates AI

OpenAI has released GPT-4, an update to the artificial intelligence model that powers its impressive and wildly popular ChatGPT generative AI.GPT-4 brings tremendous upgrades to the model, which can now accept and process data in both text and image, then respond accordingly to user inputs.GPT-4 is a massive leap forward, with the ability to process more words, formats, and data than GPT-3.5, and it could change more than we know.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

## OpenAI Reveals Upgraded GPT-4 Model

 On 14 March 2023, [OpenAI announced GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), its upgraded artificial intelligence model. GPT-4 is the culmination of a two-year process where OpenAI has rebuilt its "entire deep learning stack," [fixing ChatGPT bugs](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-chatgpt-biggest-probelms/) and AI alignment issues and building on the roaring success of ChatGPT (which uses GPT-3.5).

> A year ago, we trained GPT-3.5 as a first “test run” of the system. We found and fixed some bugs and improved our theoretical foundations. As a result, our GPT-4 training run was (for us at least!) unprecedentedly stable, becoming our first large model whose training performance we were able to accurately predict ahead of time.

 The biggest change for most users is that GPT-4 can now accept a prompt containing images and text, rather than just text. In addition, the new model can generate contextual responses based on the image you upload, creating human-like feedback even if faced with multiple images.

 OpenAI hasn't mentioned video processing yet, but one must imagine that video processing and analysis are on the horizon—or closer.

## OpenAI Showcases GPT-4 With Impressive Examples

 OpenAI also showcased GPT-4's capabilities in a live stream, which you can watch below.

 The Developer Livestream showed how GPT-4 could be used first to build a new Discord bot from scratch, which could then build out a functioning website from a crudely drawn image with a few token words. Was it basic? Yes. Did it work within seconds? Absolutely.

 The live stream focused primarily on how developers can put GPT-4 to use but was also an impressive display of GPT-4's capabilities, which will only continue to improve, especially versus [what you can do with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/).

 However, OpenAI stressed that although GPT-4 is a significant upgrade, it still has "similar limitations as earlier GPT models." GPT-4 will still lie, make falsehoods, reasoning errors, and "hallucinate facts." But, those moments should be significantly reduced, making GPT-4's outputs significantly more trustworthy and accurate than GPT-3.5\.

 It's a remarkable step forward for generative AI, that's for sure.
