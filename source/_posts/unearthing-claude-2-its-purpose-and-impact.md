## What Is Claude 2?

 Claude 2 is a [large language model](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/) developed by Anthropic AI as a base for its Claude AI chatbot. It is a successor to the Claude 1 large language model released in the first quarter of 2023\. If you haven't heard of Claude AI, it's understandable. The AI model is previously unreleased on a public-facing platform, unlike Bard, ChatGPT, or Bing AI.

 Although Claude hasn't enjoyed the same publicity as the big three AI chatbots, it is undoubtedly comparable in performance, even outdoing them in several metrics.

 Trained on a massive dataset of data scrapped from all corners of the web, Claude is built to emphasize fluid and creative conversations with additional attention to safety. While safety and guardrails are sometimes an afterthought for some AI language models, Claude was designed to be as safe as possible from its foundational stage. But what's a safe AI model if it's not useful?

 If you're wondering what you can do with the Claude AI, well, there's a lot. Like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, AnthropicAI's Claude can do most of what the new generation of AI chatbots can do. Everything from writing poems, speeches, and resumes to summarizing entire books and even writing code, is within Claude's capabilities.

 Claude is particularly renowned for its creative writing abilities. So, if your favorite chatbot is not delivering on that end, you might want to try Claude AI.

 Claude also performs impressively in programming-related tasks, one of the most popular uses of AI chatbots. It can [write, debug and explain code in dozens of programming languages like ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-programming-practical-uses/).

 Another particularly interesting thing you can do with Claude is to load it up with any file containing text and work with its knowledge. So you can upload anything from PDFs to Word documents and have Claude AI process it and come up with some insights.

 Of course, Claude AI can do much more than that. You can use it to analyze data, translate documents, summarize text, and even play games. It is all up to you and your imagination.

 If you are in the UK or the US, Claude AI is in open beta, and you can try it right now. Head to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) to sign up and start using the chatbot right away.

## How Does Claude AI Compare to Other AI Chatbots?

![Claude 2 answers questions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/claude-2-answers-questions.jpg)

[ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Bard are the three best AI chatbots](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-ai-vs-google-bard/) available. So, how does Claude AI compare to these three?

 Well, Claude AI is a bit more friendly than ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Bard. By friendly, the emphasis here is on safety. While it is still too early to say with any certainty, Claude does seem less likely to give wrong answers and is less susceptible to jailbreaking. If you've had ChatGPT and Bard AI lecture you on morals and ethics, Claude does seem to do this a lot. While some people may find this unnerving, this could be good for minors because of the tight restrictions on what it can say.

 Beyond safety, which is a big theme for Claude AI, the chatbot also has the edge over Bing AI, ChatGPT, and Bard in several metrics. In creative writing, in particular, Claude AI is more capable than Bard and can hold its own against ChatGPT running GPT-4\. Depending on what you need to be written, Claude AI outdoes Bing AI most of the time.

 In terms of coding, Claude AI outperforms Bing AI in some select cases and almost always outdoes Bard AI. ChatGPT and Claude AI are almost the same in terms of coding abilities, although ChatGPT (with GPT-4) is seemingly more robust and able to handle more complicated tasks.

 All in all, Claude AI seems to be a solid alternative to any of the top three AI chatbots that are currently dominating the field.

## Claude AI: A ChatGPT Killer in the Making?

 ChatGPT has been the top dog in the AI chatbot space since its debut in November 2022\. While a lot of AI chatbots have sprung up since that time, none of them have really been able to challenge ChatGPT in terms of performance and features. While it's still too early to call, Claude AI has all the makings of a chatbot that will give ChatGPT good competition. Will Claude AI evolve enough to displace ChatGPT as the poster child for AI chatbots? Only time will tell.
