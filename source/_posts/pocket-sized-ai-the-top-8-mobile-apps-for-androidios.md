 As GPT evolves, Bing will become smarter, and you'll be able to get instant answers for almost any query. This is just one of the many [ways AI search engines will change the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-search-engines-change-internet/).

## There's an AI App for Almost Everything

 As amazing as these AI tools are, it's wise to remember that—all things considered—the technology is still in its infancy and is likely to deliver inaccurate, inappropriate, irrelevant, or unwanted results sometimes.

 The good news is that AI is growing exponentially, so a lot of the complaints that we currently have will likely be addressed sooner than you might expect, and its benefits will be available for us all to reap. Still, it's never a bad idea to proceed with caution.
