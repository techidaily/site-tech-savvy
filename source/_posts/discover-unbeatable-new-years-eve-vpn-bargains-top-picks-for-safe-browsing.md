VPNs are an excellent way to bolster your online security. They create encrypted tunnels between your PC or mobile device to websites and online services you are trying to visit, making it more difficult to track you and keeping your traffic private.

I've reviewed all of the [top VPNs on the market](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/), and have found the best holiday VPN deals available.
