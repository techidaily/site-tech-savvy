## Save Your ChatGPT Conversations to a TXT File

 While you can [share ChatGPT conversations](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/) with others and export your entire chat history, ChatGPT doesn't have a feature that lets you download individual conversations to your local disk.

 You can achieve this by manually copying and pasting your chat into a text file. To copy your conversations manually:
