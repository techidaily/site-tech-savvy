 If you're even an occasional user of OpenAI's DALL-E 3, you've probably noticed a big change.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 I'm not talking about an updated model or a flashy new feature. No, I'm talking about DALL-E 3's switch to providing WebP files instead of PNG or JPEGs when you download your creations.

 So, if you're like me, frustrated that DALL-E 3 no longer provides those file types, I've got you covered because it's incredibly simple to convert WebP to PNG or JPEG.

## Why DALL-E 3 Is No Longer Providing PNGs or JPEGs

 While WebP files are actually reasonably useful in certain circumstances, they're not as widely used as PNG or JPEGs. Most folks have a specific use in mind when downloading files from DALL-E, and PNG or JPEG fit the bill.

![dalle image claymation person skiing in tiger suit](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dalle-image-claymation-person-skiing-in-tiger-suit.jpg)

 But if you're wondering why OpenAI suddenly stopped providing these image formats in favor of WebP, there isn't some secretive WebP consortium pushing us towards a new image format. It's a much simpler explanation than that: something broke, and it hasn't been fixed.

 At least, that's according to a moderator on the OpenAI Discord, as per a [recent Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2/comments/1ah3ruj/why%5Fdalle%5F3%5Fand%5Fthe%5Fultra%5Fis%5Fgiving%5Fme%5Fwebp%5Ffile/).

 Of course, that doesn't help you if you want to download DALL-E 3 in PNG or JPEG. Hopefully, this backend DALL-E 3 issue will be resolved before long, but until then, you need a WebP to PNG or JPEG converter.

 You should also check out [how to view WebP files on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-webp-image-viewers/) if you're struggling to view your files.

## How to Convert DALL-E 3 WebP Files to PNG or JPEG

 One of the easiest ways to convert your DALL-E 3 WebP files to PNG or JPEG is using the free online file converter Cloud Convert. It's fast, free, and offers both file types (among others.)

 Assuming you already have a WebP file:

1. Head to [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png)
2. Press **Select File**
3. Browse to the location of your WebP file and select it
4. Select **PNG** or **JPEG** from the dropdown menu featuring image formats. Now, press the spanner icon to adjust the settings. You can mostly leave this alone, but I suggest increasing the image compression quality to 100 to maintain your image.
5. Next, press **Convert** and wait for the magic to complete.

Close

 Once the conversion ends, you can **Download** the newly minted PNG or JPEG file.

 Now, if you're converting more sensitive files, you might want to choose an alternative file conversion option. We've previously looked at [how to convert WebP to PNG, JPEG, and other image formats](https://www.makeuseof.com/convert-webp-to-jpeg-png-other-image-formats/) using desktop tools, Android and iOS apps, and other cloud conversion tools.

 Hopefully, it won't be long before OpenAI fixes its issues (or explains that WebP will be its preferred image format).
