## Defining Artificial Intelligence: Power & Potential

 We often perceive artificial intelligence (AI) as computational intelligence that emulates the human mind. However, this characterization does not hold true for all AI systems, as various types of AI have distinct characteristics. Two major categories within AI are "strong AI" and "weak AI," representing different approaches to machine intelligence.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Now, let's look into the fundamental differences between strong AI and weak AI and explore the current state of AI technology.

## What Is Weak AI?

![ChatGPT chat and website open on two monitors](https://thmb.techidaily.com/b865d1fe2bcace495751c454db93866647380420be6c31ae58cdceea73012a33.jpg)

 Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, refers to AI applications that are specifically designed to automate tasks requiring a particular cognitive skill. This category of AI utilizes machine learning models tailored for specific tasks such as object recognition, chatbot interactions, personal voice assistants, autocorrect systems, and Google search algorithms, among others.

 You might be wondering why this category of AI is referred to as "weak" AI. The term "weak" may mistakenly imply that these AI applications are lacking in some way. However, it is important to recognize that the rapid advancements in AI and their pervasive impact across various industries are largely due to narrow machine intelligence. The label "weak" indicates that these applications focus on a specific or narrow cognitive function.

### Applications of Weak AI

 ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Bard are just a few examples of the AI tools that took the world by storm in 2022 and 2023\. It is remarkable that so many [professions are utilizing their widespread application](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-different-professions-using-ai/), even sparking debates about the potential for AI to replace humans and leaving many of us with the question, "[Can ChatGPT replace me?](http://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-replace-me/)"

 However, it's important to note that these amazing tools are still classified as examples of "weak AI" in action.

 Let's explore seven common applications of weak AI:

1. **Email spam filters:** Features designed to detect and divert spam emails to the spam folder.
2. **Chatbots:** Tools that utilize [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/) to interact with humans are another instance of weak AI.
3. **AI artists:** Computer-generated art using AI can transform natural language instructions into images and also falls under the umbrella of narrow AI.
4. **Smart voice assistants:** Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and others can perform numerous tasks on your behalf by responding to voice commands.
5. **Social media algorithms:** The recommendations on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or even Spotify are all powered by weak AI algorithms.
6. **Autonomous driving:** The [self-driving feature in vehicles](https://www.makeuseof.com/not-just-tesla-cars-with-self-driving-features/) is yet another application of weak AI.
7. **Healthcare:** [AI applications in healthcare](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-ai-apps-monitor-your-health/), such as medical diagnostic systems capable of identifying diseases with minimal human intervention, serve as additional examples of weak AI in action.

 Despite the term "weak AI," it's clear that it has numerous real-world applications that we're already using.

### Limitations of Weak AI

 The primary reason for the limitations of AI today is its focus on automating specific tasks for humans. For example, ChatGPT and Google Bard are designed as [large language models (LLMs)](http://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/). They are specifically programmed for generating text-based content. Similarly, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are text-to-image generators limited to this particular function.

 Let's explore some of the limitations and drawbacks of weak AI:

* Limited capabilities due to task-specific models.
* Narrow AI applications depend highly on data, requiring large datasets to learn and perform certain tasks.
* By extension, the use of large datasets can create privacy and data processing issues.,
* Weak AI often relies on human intervention to execute tasks, which can introduce human biases into the process.
* These applications may be susceptible to cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

 However, despite these limitations, tools like ChatGPT have become effectively indispensable within a short period of public release.

## What Is Strong AI or AGI?

![Image of a white robot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-of-a-white-robot.jpg)

 In contrast to weak AI exists strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). This form of AI is based on the belief that computational power can emulate human brain capabilities, including analytical thinking and other intellectual abilities. Strong AI aims to create machines capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do, not necessarily in the same way as humans.

 Unlike weak AI, strong AI does not rely on specific programmed models for performing narrow tasks. Instead, it possesses the potential to handle general tasks by simulating human brain functions. AGI has the ability to enable technological systems to evolve over time and adapt to changes in the environment.

 It will be strong AI that will likely lead to the singularity. However, it is important to note that strong AI is still a distant goal, as much of the work in this field remains largely theoretical. The concept of strong AI itself often draws inspiration from science fiction movies and novels.

### Applications of Strong AI

 Since the development of strong AI still needs to be completed, finding it in practical, real-world scenarios is nearly impossible, rendering much of the talk about its use and development purely theoretical. However, here are five anticipated applications where strong AI could be utilized:

1. **Emotional intelligence and thought processing:** The understanding of human emotions and thought processes can be incorporated into AGI systems, benefiting industries such as healthcare, education, and customer services.
2. **Decision-making:** Machines equipped with strong AI can possess the ability to make autonomous decisions based on rationality.
3. **Evolution:** Strong AI systems could enable machines to adapt and modify themselves to better fit their surroundings.
4. **Consciousness:** Self-awareness and conscious decision-making capabilities could be achieved through strong AI systems.
5. **Artificial creativity:** Strong AI may unlock the potential for artificial creativity, allowing machines to generate innovative ideas without human instructions.

 Despite the largely theoretical nature of AGI, it clearly has enormous potential.

### Limitations of Strong AI

 Strong AI or AGI has the potential to be transformative for our society. However, several considerations and challenges must be addressed when implementing such systems.

* Complexity, as strong AI requires vast amounts of data and high computational power for training.
* Ethical considerations that arise from the uncertainty surrounding the behavior of strong AI in real-world scenarios (e.g., AGI systems may make harmful decisions for humans).
* AGI systems will rely heavily on human data, which may lead to human-borne biases.
* Security and responsibility for the actions of strong AI (e.g., determining who should be held accountable when things go wrong).

 Given the world-changing potential of AGI, extensive regulation must be in place before any such product is released to the public. It's already been [difficult enough regulating generative AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-government-may-regulate-ai-tools/), and AGI will ramp those issues up another notch.

## Differences Between Strong and Weak AI

 There are several notable differences between strong and weak AI in terms of their purpose, learning method, and problem-solving approach. Let's explore these distinctions.

### Purpose

 A notable difference between the two artificial intelligence systems lies in their purpose. Weak AI systems are primarily designed to automate specific processes and perform well-defined tasks, leading to increased efficiency in various fields.

 On the other hand, strong AI systems, though hypothetical, aim to mimic the functioning of the human brain. These systems can arguably possess self-awareness, consciousness, and analytical capabilities, enabling them to undertake a wide range of general tasks, much like humans.

### Learning Method

 Narrow AI and AGI systems also diverge in their learning methods. Narrow AI relies on specific datasets to learn patterns and perform repetitive tasks. Typically, weak AI processes data by classifying it based on predetermined criteria.

 In contrast, AGI mechanisms require extensive amounts of data to perform general duties, aiming to mimic the cognitive processes of the human mind. Consequently, AGIs employ data clustering and linking methods to process and analyze information.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Approach for Problem-Solving

 Weak AI systems are specifically engineered for repetitive tasks that necessitate close examination of datasets and pattern recognition. This enables the system to make reliable predictions and outcomes.

 In comparison, strong AI takes a problem-solving approach geared toward tackling more intricate and creative tasks. It relies on extensive datasets and continuously evolves to adapt to new conditions and challenges.

## The Current State of AI Technology

 Today, our daily mundane tasks are primarily automated by narrow or weak AI. However, these systems lack the cognitive abilities and analytical thinking that come naturally to the human brain. Consequently, researchers and developers are currently focusing on advancing AI to incorporate more human-like computational systems.

 Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be far more sophisticated than its weak AI counterparts. Nonetheless, AGI is still in its early stages of development and has a long way to go before becoming a reality.
