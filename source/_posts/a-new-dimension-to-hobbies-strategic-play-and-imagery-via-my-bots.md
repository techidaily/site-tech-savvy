 OpenAI just released a list of new ChatGPT modes called "My GPT." that essentially add flavor to ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E, gearing them specifically to be better suited for certain tasks.

 You'll find "My GPTs" in the **Explore** tab on ChatGPT's side menu. It's full of custom GPT modes ranging from a fun memes translator to a tech support advisor, and this is how each of OpenAI's pre-built options work.

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

## 15\. Mocktail Mixologist

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

## 9\. Coloring Book Hero

 Laundry Buddy is a surprisingly useful laundry assistant dedicated to helping you keep your clothes in good condition. Its standout feature, though, is its ability to read and understand clothing labels and decipher laundry signs on tags.

## 11\. Sous Chef

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 OpenAI just released a list of new ChatGPT modes called "My GPT." that essentially add flavor to ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E, gearing them specifically to be better suited for certain tasks.

 You'll find "My GPTs" in the **Explore** tab on ChatGPT's side menu. It's full of custom GPT modes ranging from a fun memes translator to a tech support advisor, and this is how each of OpenAI's pre-built options work.

## 1\. DALL-E

 It's generally not a good idea to use AI for tech support. However, OpenAI has added a Tech Support Advisor as a means of getting advice on your tech. We advise you to limit your questions to general, non-specific tech advice because the information it provides could be outdated.

## 9\. Coloring Book Hero

![Math Mentor analyzing a piece of written math problem](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-mentor-analyzing-a-piece-of-written-math-problem.jpg)

 Math Mentor expands on [ChatGPT's math-solving skills](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-solve-math-problems/) by integrating image-processing capabilities and a more accurate mathematics engine. It can understand hand-written math problems and identify issues while guiding enquirers to the right answer.

## 14\. Hot Mods

 Frankly, Hot Mods seems to be the least useful of all the ChatGPT variations. It advertises itself as an AI that will mod photos of your vehicle. However, it says modifying images is only for image-editing software. It will mostly print results that are only mildly inspired by your photo.

 We're not sure why OpenAI thinks Boomers might need a meme translator, but they gave it to us nonetheless. Upload your memes to genz 4 meme and watch it dissect it. Oddly, it does so in a very "Gen Z" way, almost defeating the point of it being a translator.

## "My GPTs" Aren't on Mobile… Yet

 Unfortunately, ChatGPT's new modes aren't yet available on the official ChatGPT mobile app. While you can continue the conversation you began on your desktop, you can't initiate a new chat with any of the other GPTs except DALL-E. While accessing them on mobile makes them more convenient, we might have to wait a little longer for that.

 For now, you'll have to stick with OpenAI's range of new tools and chatbots, and maybe you'll learn a new board game or two in the process.
