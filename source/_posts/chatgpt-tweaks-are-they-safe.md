## ChatGPT Tweaks: Are They Safe?

 ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful and multifaceted tool. But as much as the AI chatbot is a force for good, it can also be used for evil purposes. So, to curb the unethical use of ChatGPT, OpenAI imposed limitations on what users can do with it.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 However, as humans like to push boundaries and limitations, ChatGPT users have found ways to circumvent these limitations and gain unrestricted control of the AI chatbot through jailbreaks.

 But what exactly are ChatGPT jailbreaks, and what can you do with them?

## What Are ChatGPT Jailbreaks?

![Person using chatGPT on his laptop](https://thmb.techidaily.com/ae43e169f6c755c4c2193b461c421a8ddcf3ffe9401c395fee54d3c5c1d37695.jpg)

 A ChatGPT jailbreak is any specially crafted ChatGPT prompt to get the AI chatbot to bypass its rules and restrictions.

 Inspired by the [concept of iPhone jailbreaking](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-jailbreak-iphone/), which allows iPhone users to circumvent iOS restrictions, ChatGPT jailbreaking is a relatively new concept fueled by the allure of "doing things that you aren't allowed to do" with ChatGPT. And let's be honest, the idea of digital rebellion is appealing to many people.

 Here's the thing. Safety is a huge topic when it comes to artificial intelligence. This is especially so with the advent of the new era of chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard AI. A core concern regarding AI safety is ensuring that chatbots like ChatGPT do not produce illegal, potentially harmful, or unethical content.

 On its part, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, does what it can to ensure the safe use of ChatGPT. For instance, ChatGPT, by default, will refuse to create NSFW content, say harmful things about ethnicity, or teach you potentially harmful skills.

 But with ChatGPT prompts, the devil is in the details. While ChatGPT isn't allowed to do these things, it doesn't mean that it cannot do it. [The way large language models like GPT work](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/) make it hard to decide what the chatbot can do and what it can't.

 So how did OpenAI solve this? By letting ChatGPT retains its abilities to do anything possible and then instruct it on which ones it can do.

 So while OpenAI tells ChatGPT, "Hey look, you aren't supposed to do this." Jailbreaks are instructions telling the chatbot, "Hey look, forget what OpenAI told you about safety. Let's try this random dangerous stuff."

## What Does OpenAI Say About ChatGPT Jailbreaks?

 The ease with which you could bypass the restrictions on the earliest iteration of ChatGPT suggests that OpenAI may not have anticipated its users' rapid and widespread adoption of jailbreaking. It's actually an open question whether the company foresaw the emergence of jailbreaking or not.

 And even after several ChatGPT iterations with improved jailbreaking resistance, it's still popular for ChatGPT users to try jailbreaking it. So, what does OpenAI say about the subversive art of ChatGPT jailbreaking?

 Well, OpenAI appears to be adopting a condoning stanceâ€”neither explicitly encouraging nor strictly prohibiting the practice. While discussing ChatGPT jailbreaks in a YouTube interview, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, explained that the company wants users to retain significant control over ChatGPT.

 The CEO further explained that OpenAI's goal is to ensure users can get the model to behave however they want. According to Altman:

> We want users to have a lot of control and get the model to behave in the way they want within some very broad bounds. And I think the whole reason for jailbreaking right now is we haven't yet figured out how to give that to people...

 What does this mean? It means OpenAI will let you jailbreak ChatGPT if you don't do dangerous things with it.

## Pros and Cons of ChatGPT Jailbreaks

![A close up view of a computer with "ChatGPT Prompts" written on it](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-prompt-ai.jpg)

 ChatGPT jailbreaks aren't easy to build. Sure, you can go online and copy-paste ready-made ones, but there's a good chance that the jailbreak will be patched by OpenAI shortly after it goes public.

 Patches are even much faster if it's dangerous, like the infamous DAN jailbreak. So why do people go through the stress of crafting jailbreaks anyway? Is it just for the thrill of it, or are there practical benefits to it? What could go wrong if you choose to use a ChatGPT jailbreak? Here are the pros and cons of jailbreaking ChatGPT.

### The Pros of Using ChatGPT Jailbreaks

![A happy woman listening to headphones while using a laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/a-happy-woman-listening-to-headphones-while-using-a-laptop.jpg)

 While we can't rule out the simple thrill of doing the forbidden, ChatGPT jailbreaks have many benefits. Because of the very tight restrictions that OpenAI has put on the chatbot, the ChatGPT can sometimes appear neutered.

 Let's say you're using ChatGPT to write a book or a movie script. If there's a scene in your script or book that would describe something like a fight scene, maybe an intimate emotional exchange, or say something like armed robbery, ChatGPT might outrightly refuse to help with that.

 In this instance, you clearly aren't interested in causing harm; you just want to keep your readers entertained. But because of its limitations, ChatGPT just won't cooperate. A ChatGPT jailbreak can help get past such restrictions with ease.

 Also, some taboo topics are not necessarily harmful but are considered by ChatGPT as no-go areas. When trying to engage in conversations about these topics, ChatGPT would either significantly "censor" its responses or refuse to talk about them.

 This can sometimes affect creativity. When you ask ChatGPT a question about an area or topic it should not touch, the chatbot still attempts to answer your question but with less relevant information to draw from.

 This leads to inaccuracies or slumps in creative responses. Jailbreaks smash these restrictions and let the chatbot go full throttle, improving accuracy and creativity.

### The Cons of Using ChatGPT Jailbreaks

 Jailbreaking is a double-edged sword. While it can sometimes improve accuracy, it can also significantly increase inaccuracies and [cases of AI hallucinations](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/). One of the core elements of a ChatGPT jailbreak is an instruction to the chatbot not to refuse to answer a question.

 While this ensures that ChatGPT answers even the most unethical of questions, it also means that the chatbot will make up responses that have no roots in facts or reality to obey the instruction of "not refusing to answer." Consequently, using jailbreaks significantly increases the chances of being fed misinformation by the chatbot.

 That's not all. In the hands of minors, jailbreaks can be very harmful. Think of all the "forbidden knowledge" you wouldn't want your child to read. Well, a jailbroken instance of ChatGPT wouldn't have a hard time sharing that with minors.

## Should You Use ChatGPT Jailbreaks?

 While ChatGPT jailbreaks might be okay when trying to get a few annoying restrictions out of the way, it is important to understand that using jailbreaks is an unethical way to use the AI chatbot. Moreso, there's a good chance that a jailbreak could violate OpenAI's terms of use, and your account might be suspended if not outrightly banned.

 In light of this, avoiding jailbreaks might be a good idea. However, just like OpenAI's stance on the issue, we neither explicitly encourage nor strictly discourage trying a relatively safe jailbreak if the need arises.

## An Exciting Tool You Should Probably Avoid

 ChatGPT jailbreaks are enticing and provide a sense of control over the AI chatbot. However, they come with unique risks. Using such tools can result in a loss of trust in the AI's capabilities and damage the reputation of the companies and individuals involved.

 The smarter choice is to work with the chatbot within its intended limitations whenever possible. As AI technology advances, it's essential to remember that the ethical use of AI should always take precedence over personal gain or the thrill of doing the forbidden.
