## Logitech's Pebble 2 Set: The Ideal Apple Elegance in Keyboard & Mouse Combo

Looking to make your desk space look great? Logitech has a keyboard and mouse combo set for you.

 Apple products just have a certain aesthetic, which is not often replicated with PC peripherals. While a normal keyboard and mouse will work fine with almost any PC and Mac, why not get something that matches your stylish iMac or MacBook instead? I, for one, want both style and function, and it's even better if I can save some money while doing so.

 The [Logitech Pebble 2 Combo](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Customizable-Bluetooth-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4NFZB7?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002550&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-pebble-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is the perfect mix of all three. While the Pebble 2 looks similar to the [Logitech POP line](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Customizable-Connectivity-Multi-Device/dp/B09KGW7CNN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002550&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-pebble-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), the Pebble 2 has a more professional look, so they blend in more easily in a work or office environment. If you're on the go a lot, the combo set is also great in that it's extremely portableâ€”giving you a bit more of an ergonomic setup than just a MacBook by itself.

 In terms of aesthetics, you can get the combo in [Graphite](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Customizable-Bluetooth-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4DNHS5?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002550&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-pebble-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) or [White](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Customizable-Bluetooth-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4J2KMR?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002550&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-pebble-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), and there is also a special [Blue colorway](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Customizable-Bluetooth-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4NFZB7?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002550&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-pebble-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) on Amazon that looks great with the blue iMac. Logitech's store page also have a [Tonal Rose color](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/combos/pebble-2-keyboard-mouse-combo.920-012199.html) that goes great with anything pink or rose gold in your set up. Couple the color of your choice with a [Logitech mouse pad](https://amazon.com/dp/B09DV56338?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002550&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Flogitech-pebble-2%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), and you'll have a matching space in no time without emptying out your wallet.

 This keyboard and mouse combo is already a steal at the full $60 price, but now, it's $10 off on Amazon and Logitech, bringing the total down to $50\. There's no reason to not pick the Pebble 2 combo up and give it a try!
