## Augmenting Crypto Dialogues: GPT's Top 8 Integrative Tools Revealed

 Navigating the crypto world can be quite daunting. From understanding new terminologies, courtesy of a fast-evolving industry, to keeping up with market trends, it's easy to get lost in the chaos of investing in the most volatile financial assets.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Nevertheless, you can make the adventure much more enjoyable if you take advantage of several tools. For instance, these ChatGPT crypto plugins can help you with almost every information-based need.

 So, what are the best crypto plugins for ChatGPT, and what do they do?

 On March 19, 2024, [OpenAI disabled ChatGPT Plugin](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8988022-winding-down-the-chatgpt-plugins-beta) conversations and completely removed them on April 9, 2024\. ChatGPT Plugins were removed because much of their functionality can be found in [custom GPTs and the GPT Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-custom-gpt-store/).

## 1\. Crypto Jobs List

 The Crypto Jobs List plugin is designed to assist users in finding jobs in the crypto industry. Created by [Crypto Jobs List](https://cryptojobslist.com/), a Web3 talent sourcing company, the plugin fetches data on job opportunities and descriptions from the website and uses it to locate job opportunities. It allows you to interact with it to find specific job roles, learn about required qualifications, and gain insights into the crypto job market. You can specify your location, niche, and even salary range to get a list of job opportunities that match your preference. For instance, we used the tool to find a couple of remote cryptocurrency content-writing jobs.

![A screenshot of Crypto Jobs List plugin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-jobs-list.jpg)

 While Crypto Jobs List is a good plugin to start with when searching for jobs, you'd benefit even more by using a general plugin like Job Search by Indeed, which has a larger database of jobs spanning all industries, including cryptocurrency.

## 2\. CCData.io

 The CCData.io plugin is designed to provide real-time and historical data on various cryptocurrencies. It's powered by [CCData](https://ccdata.io/), an online platform launched in 2014 to provide institutions with actionable data on digital assets. Using the plugin, you can access information such as prices, [market capitalization](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-market-capitalization/), and trading volumes while tracking various cryptocurrencies' performance and analyzing market trends to make informed investment decisions. The plugin also keeps you up to date with the latest blockchain projects, such as initial coin offerings.

![Screenshot CCData.io plugin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ccdata-io.jpg)

 The example above listed Cardano as the fastest-growing established cryptocurrency in the last month based on data it had collected. With such insights, you can easily reduce the time and effort needed to make investment decisions.

## 3\. DAIZY

 DAIZY is designed to help you access financial data and analyze assets, including US stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies. Created by [Daizy Inc](https://www.daizy.com/), the tool leverages its huge, regularly updated database of information to determine cryptocurrency projects' performance, risk metrics, and sustainability based on ESG score (Environmental Social and Governance). You can compare assets against benchmarks to assess your performance and learn how new stories may impact different types of assets. Generally, it's a one-stop solution that simplifies digital asset research and analysis.

![Screenshot of DAIZY plugin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/daizy.jpg)

 Above is a list of some of the best-performing ETFs over the past year based on data collected by DAIZY. While it only partially covers the available ETFs in the market, it's a great starting point for research.

## 4\. GoPlus Security AI

[GoPlus Security](https://gopluslabs.io/) was created to make Web3 safer by detecting and addressing security risks through its dynamic and automated platform. Its ChatGPT plugin provides a one-stop solution for comprehensive security content, including real-time updates and free primary data. It can also cover various aspects of the crypto security ecosystem, such as malicious addresses, token security, and DApp security statuses. The origin company is committed to integrating the best security data to protect projects and cryptocurrency users.

![Screenshot of GoPlus Security plugin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/goplus-security.jpg)

 In the case above, we used the plugin to check whether the project Alien Worlds had been flagged for any security issues to guide us on whether it would be wise to invest in the project. You can do much more with such a powerful tool.

## 5\. Alchemy

[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)'s ChatGPT plugin is a tool that allows users to access blockchain data. It works with Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism blockchains providing users with real-time information using Alchemy's Web3 APIs. You can access account balances, tokens metadata, block information, and fee data pegged on network conditions. Due to the character limitations of ChatGPT, the plugin responds within the limitation. Also, the plugin is trained on a fixed set of API methods rather than real-time off-chain data.

 We tried to find out the current gas fee for sending $100 worth of ETH, and the above response is what we got. The tool noted that [Ethereum gas fees](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees-why-so-high/) don't depend on the amount being traded but on the network conditions.

## 7\. SignalPlus

[Signal Plus](https://www.signalplus.com/) is an all-in-one platform that empowers users to participate in options trading for digital assets.

## 8\. Polygon

 The Polygon ChatGPT tool is a research tool designed to enhance financial investment analysis.
