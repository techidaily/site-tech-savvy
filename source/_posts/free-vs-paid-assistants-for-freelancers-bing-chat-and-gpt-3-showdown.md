## Free vs Paid Assistants for Freelancers: Bing Chat & GPT-3 Showdown

 ChatGPT and Bing Chat rank among the most widely used generative AI tools today. Freelancers use them to automate their routine work. With these chatbots, you’ll have an easier time generating content ideas, researching topics, and crafting marketing assets.

## 1\. Bing Chat Lists Down Its Sources

![Bing Chat Listing Its Sources for Outputs](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-lists-sources.jpg)

 Professionals are often cautious when using chatbots for research as these tools don't independently verify facts. AI only states the information in its datasets. Although it references widely trusted sources, inaccuracies may still appear occasionally.

 Despite these errors, you can still use AI tools like Bing Chat and ChatGPT for preliminary research. They break down complex subjects. You’ll find academic journals and research papers less intimidating once you have a basic knowledge of their topics.

 For easier fact-checking, use Bing Chat. Unlike ChatGPT, it lists down all its sources whenever it references claims, statistics, and trivia.

## 2\. ChatGPT Is Available on Google Chrome

 You must set Microsoft Edge as your primary browser to use Bing Chat efficiently. It’s not accessible elsewhere. If you try hitting the Chat button on Bing, you’ll get a prompt asking you to install Edge.

![Bing Asking User to Download Microsoft Edge](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-prompt-to-download-microsoft-edge.jpg)

 Unfortunately, Microsoft Edge is not as popular as some other web browsers. Like millions of other working adults, you probably prefer using Google Chrome. It’s the most widely used browser. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/) even reports that Google Chrome has a whopping 66.14 percent market share.

 Unless you can migrate your data to Microsoft Edge, consider using ChatGPT by default. [Toggling between work apps wastes too much time](https://www.makeuseof.com/toggling-work-applications-how-to-resolve/).

## 3\. Bing Chat Is Connected to the Internet

 If your job typically involves current events or industry developments, you should likely choose Bing Chat over ChatGPT. They pull information differently.

 OpenAI trained ChatGPT to produce outputs based on its datasets. Meanwhile, Bing Chat runs search queries at every prompt, allowing it to generate more accurate, timely results. ChatGPT’s limited datasets may contain outdated, incoherent data.

 Likewise, ChatGPT’s model has limited knowledge of real-world events after 2021\. It can’t access publications and media outlets. The platform even malfunctions when you ask for simple weather updates.

![ChatGPT Can't Provide Weather Update Because It's Not Connected to the Internet](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-can-t-answer-weather-update.jpg)

 Meanwhile, Bing Chat has access to real-time sources. The below image shows its capacity to produce comprehensive weather updates based on your location.

## 4\. Bing Chat Offers GPT-4 for Free

 You must pay for ChatGPT Plus to access GPT-4\. Free ChatGPT users can only use GPT-3.5, although they might get a slight upgrade [when GPT-5 launches](https://www.makeuseof.com/when-will-gpt5-launch/). Alternatively, Bing Chat offers GPT-4 for free. Just download Microsoft Edge, and you’re good to go—there’s no need to buy anything else.

 ChatGPT Plus costs $20 a month. While the fees won’t make you go bankrupt, you might want to minimize your expenses if you already have other premium tools. Otherwise, your subscriptions might eat up your profits.

## 5\. You Can Use Bing Chat on Different Platforms

Close

 Freelancers can install Bing Chat on all their work devices. Bing makes up for its unavailability on Google Chrome with cross-platform accessibility. It runs on:

* **Microsoft Edge:** Microsoft Edge lets you pull up Bing Chat quickly through a browser extension. You don’t have to keep switching to Bing’s website.
* **Bing Mobile:** [Bing Chat is available on iOS and Android devices](https://www.makeuseof.com/bing-egde-skype-chatpgt-android-iphone/). The app is popular among professionals who use smartphones for work tasks, e.g., salespeople, social media managers, and eCommerce entrepreneurs.
* **Skype:** Bing is available on Skype. Either message Bing privately or add the chatbot to your group chats. This feature is helpful if you often talk to your clients and coworkers on Skype.

## 6\. ChatGPT Has Less Rigid Restrictions

 If you need versatility, use ChatGPT. It follows less rigid restrictions than Bing Chat. You can even bypass certain rules by phrasing your prompts differently. Your instructions’ word choice, tone, and language drastically change output quality—keep testing prompt variations.

 Take the below prompt as an example. ChatGPT rejected our role-play request because Tomie is an evil fictional character.

![ChatGPT Refuses to Roleplay as Tomie the Character](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-rejects-roleplay-request-as-tomie.jpg)

 But it obliged after we rephrased our prompt.

![ChatGPT Roleplaying as Tomie from the Manga Tomie](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-accepting-roleplay-request.jpg)

 Meanwhile, Bing Chat ignored our requests outright, regardless of our phrasing.

![Bing Chat Rejecting Roleplay Request Due to Security Restrictions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bing-chat-rejecting-request.jpg)

 Make a list of jailbreak instructions. Learning how GPT models analyze and absorb inputs will help you [write more effective AI prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/). You could even create template formulas.

 Just note that some jailbreak prompts might stop working. OpenAI routinely updates its guidelines to prevent crooks from exploiting ChatGPT’s vulnerabilities.

## 7\. Bing Chat Mimics Human-Like Text Better

 Regardless of your profession, never claim ownership of AI-generated content. AI only references third-party sources. ChatGPT rephrases information from its datasets, while Bing Chat excerpts output from relevant sites. Either way, passing them off as your own classifies as plagiarism.

 With that said, there are ways to write with AI tools ethically. You could use them to:

* **Write a Cover Letter:**[Ask AI to draft your cover letter](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-cover-letter-using-chatgpt/). It should help you find a concise yet attention-grabbing way to introduce yourself.
* **Answer Work Emails:**[Feed confusing work emails to AI](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-chatgpt-write-work-emails/) and see how it responds. You could even ask your chatbot to adopt the language and tone of a persona, e.g., a male employee in his 30s.

 ChatGPT and Bing Chat both generate human-like text. However, since Bing Chat runs on GPT-4, it produces more natural-sounding phrases.

 The below image shows a sample cover letter by ChatGPT. It’s grammatically correct, but it also sounds stiff and awkward.

![ChatGPT Writing a Cover Letter for a Content Writer Application](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-writing-cover-letter-1.jpg)

 Meanwhile, Bing Chat’s phrases flow smoothly.

## 8\. OpenAI Offers Several AI Tools

 Freelancers who already use OpenAI tools should stick with ChatGPT. Not only do they integrate well with each other, but they also record progress on the same in-platform API keys. They make project organization easier.

 Explore OpenAI’s systems. Developers, programmers, and prompt engineers might find them helpful. You could even build AI-integrated apps from scratch.

## Find the Right AI Chatbot for Your Freelance Business

 Whether you should get Bing Chat or ChatGPT depends on your freelancing needs. If your job involves extensive research, use Bing Chat. It lists its sources and lets you use the search engine quickly. Alternatively, ChatGPT suits OpenAI coders and programmers who prefer testing versatile platforms compatible with Google Chrome.

 If you still can’t decide between Bing Chat and ChatGPT, keep trying various prompts. You’ll likely uncover more differences. Compare their security restrictions, output limitations, versatility, and input comprehension.
