[Generative AI is changing the job market](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-ai-change-job-market/) in many ways, but one especially useful function is helping you to filter job openings by industry, job title, and location preferences. This helps save time and effort by limiting your search to only positions that meet your criteria. It can also provide more details about the employment offered, including the required qualifications and duties.

 ChatGPT can also assist you in creating a targeted resume by suggesting keywords and phrases to include based on the job description. You may also request that ChatGPT analyze your existing resume and give you feedback and pointers on improving it.
