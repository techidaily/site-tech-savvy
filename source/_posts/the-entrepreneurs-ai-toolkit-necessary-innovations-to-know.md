 Most people have heard of [OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT chatbot](https://hix.ai/alternatives/chatgpt-alternative). This AI tool has gained international fame for its ability to mimic human conversations and provide concise, well-formatted information. But how can ChatGPT help your business?

 You can use ChatGPT to help with many aspects of your business, such as SEO, by asking for help with keyword research or information about trends. You can also ask ChatGPT to help with the content you want to make by inspiring you with some ideas.

 You can use ChatGPT for free if you settle for older versions of the tool, but GPT-4 offers the best experience. You can access ChatGPT directly through OpenAI or by using numerous third-party services.

## 3\. Google Cloud Dialogflow

![google cloud dialogflow website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/google-cloud-dialogflow-homepage.jpg)

 Unlike ChatGPT, [Google Cloud Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) isn’t a chatbot itself; it’s a tool that allows you to build realistic conversations for your own chatbots. The scope of this tool is incredible, with Google’s wealth of data contributing to training algorithms that make it very easy to make responsive chatbots.

 This is great for businesses that want to greet users and help them on their website, provide support for users, and even handle sales flows that would otherwise require a person to help. The main downside of Dialogflow is the learning curve.

## 4\. OpenAI Dall-E 2 AI Image Generator

![open ai dall e 2 website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/open-ai-dall-e-2-homepage.jpg)

 It’s time to look at another tool from OpenAI. [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) is an image generator that uses text-based prompts to create artwork from data. This tool is able to generate unique images that give marketing teams the ability to enhance their content without having to use stock images.

 While it is unlikely that Dall-E 2 will be taking the jobs of product photographers any time soon, this tool is still great for businesses with low marketing budgets. Unlike many other AI image generators, you can edit your images directly within Dall-E 2\.
