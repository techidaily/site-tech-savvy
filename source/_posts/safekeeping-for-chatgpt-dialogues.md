## How to Natively Save a ChatGPT Conversation

 Whenever you write a prompt in the ChatGPT chat platform, it automatically saves your chat using a name adapted from your prompt. In order to help you remember saved chats easily, you might want to edit their title using a more concise and descriptive short text. To do this:

## Save Your ChatGPT Conversations to a TXT File

 While you can [share ChatGPT conversations](https://www.makeuseof.com/share-chatgpt-chats-links/) with others and export your entire chat history, ChatGPT doesn't have a feature that lets you download individual conversations to your local disk.

 You can achieve this by manually copying and pasting your chat into a text file. To copy your conversations manually:

![Conversation history highlight ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/conversation-history-highlight-chatgpt.jpg)

1. Start highlighting the chat texts from the top using your cursor.
2. Proceed by holding down **Shift + PgDn** on your keyboard until you reach the last text in the conversation thread.
3. Once on the last text, press **Ctrl + C** or **Cmd + C** on your keyboard or right-click and select **Copy** to copy the chat to your clipboard.
4. Open the Notepad or any text editor on your computer and paste this conversation into it. Then save the file with a TXT extension.

## Save Your ChatGPT Chat to HTML or PDF Files Using Browser Extensions

[Export ChatGPT Conversation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-chatgpt-conversati/clgidpflecgaaabfcmdmkcgebpbadgoc/) is a Chrome extension that lets you copy your entire chat thread to your clipboard or download it to your local drive as HTML. You can also use this extension to export chats to your Notion workspace.

 First, go to the extension marketplace and add this extension to Chrome. Once installed:

1. Open your ChatGPT conversation and go to the chat thread you want to download.
2. Go to the extension icon in the top-right corner of your Chrome browser and click the **Export ChatGPT Conversation** extension.
