## Step 1: Check the Power Supply

 Turn on your computer. If you cannot hear fans starting and cannot see anything on the screen, please follow the steps bellow to check the status of your power supply and make sure that it is problem-free.

* For**laptop users** , please follow the instructions below to check your power supply.

 1) Double check to make sure that the charger is the right one for your laptop. Many laptops, especially laptops from the same manufacturer, use the same size plug. If you have more than one laptops, it is easy for you to plug in the wrong power supply.

 2) Use a spare cable to see if it is the problem of your fuse in the plug. If you don’t have a spare power cable, please use a screwdriver to remove the fuse and install one that is known to be good.

 3) Check the wire. If your power supply is beaten up, especially if you can see the colored wires inside the black outer protection, it could be time to buy a new power supply unit.

* For**desktop users** , please follow the steps below check your power supply.
  
 1) Double check the power cable to make sure that it is plugged in and the outlet is working.

 2) Ensure that the power switch on the back of its case, on the power supply, is set to the On position. If it still won’t power on at all, it’s possible you disconnected a power cable inside its case. If you haven’t been messing around inside the case, it’s possible the power supply is dead. In this case, you’ll have to get your computer’s hardware fixed or get a new computer.

 Be sure to check your computer monitor. If your computer seems to power on but your screen stays black, ensure your monitor is powered on and that the cable connecting it to your computer’s case is plugged in securely at both ends.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Step 2: Remove External Devices

 1) Remove or disconnect all unnecessary discs and devices from the computer. Make sure that the computer is**off** , and then remove any discs and USB devices and the memory cards from the card reader slot. Disconnect non-essential devices such as camera, MP3-playersprinters, scanners, external hard drives etc., and leave**mouse** ,**keyboard** and**monitor** connected.

 2) Turn on the computer. After you have removed the devices mentioned above, turn on the computer.

 3) If your computer starts well, reconnect the devices back on one by one. This will help you figure out which device is causing the problem.

 4) If your computer won’t start and the same problem exists, press and hold the power button to turn off the computer. Please make sure that you don’t connect any external devices to your computer for now.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Step 3: Perform a Hard Reboot

 If you**CANNOT**  log into the Windows 10, you can perform a hard reboot on your computer. This will allow you to go to the**Advanced options** page, where you are able to perform a refresh or a reset of your Windows 10\.

**Warning** : Please do not try this when your computer is at a good state. Restarting a computer without support of operating system could result in data loss, incomplete installations and suspension and corruption of any processes that were running before the reboot.

1) Press and hold the power button on your computer until it powers off.

2) Press the power button on your computer to turn it on.

3) Repeat step 1) and 2) until you see**Please wait** during the boot. It usually takes three repeats (more than three repeats if this is not the first time that you did this) for it to come up. You need to try until you can see the**Please wait** coming out.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 4) When the following page shows, tab or click**See advanced repair options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/recovery-it-looks-like-windows-didnt-load-correctly.jpg)

 5) Choose**Troubleshoot.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 6) Then you will be seeing a page similar to the following one. You could choose**Startup Repair** since your computer refuse to load. (You can also do a[system restore](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you have previously created a system restore point.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e332be2293.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 7) Follow the on-screen instructions to continue with the system repair.

 8) Your computer will reboot automatically if the repair goes well. And you should be able to see the login screen when the self-repair finishes.

## Step 4: Perform a system restore

 When you have successfully booted into the Advanced repair option page, there is another thing that you can do: do a system restore, on the basis that you have turned this feature on previously. Here is how you do it:

 1) Repeat step 1) to 5) in the above method. When in the Advanced options page, click**System Restore** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e358da77cc.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) Follow the on-screen instructions and choose a restore point for you to go back to.

**NOTE** : If you have not created a restore point, or that you didn’t manually turn on the system restore point feature in Windows 10, you might see this instead:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e35e350ad6.jpg)

 In such case, you may need to use a recovery disc or a USB drive to boot, provided that you manage to get the installation files for Windows 10 from other sources.

## Step 5: Run disk check

 This method has been proved by a big number of users to be effective. So we think you may want to have a try:

 1) Do a hard reboot on your computer, and click**Command Prompt** when you are here:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e39f67a517.jpg)

2) In the Command Prompt window, type

chkdsk c: /r /x

 and press the**Enter** key on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e3a862c3ed.png)

3) Wait for the scan process to finish.

 Your PC should be able to boot now. If not, you may need to consider do a system reset or refresh.

## Step 6: Refresh or Rest your computer

A **refresh**  on Windows 10 will help you reinstall Windows 10\. However, it will **remove**  the applications and drivers that you have installed and your personal settings will be changed back to default as well. It will also remove applications from your computer manufacturer but the apps you installed from the Windows store will remain.

A **reset**  on Windows 10 will help you reinstall Windows 10 and removes **ALL**  your personal files. The drivers, the applications, the personal changes that you made to settings, and the applications installed by your computer manufacturer will be removed as well. However, if your computer came with Windows 10, apps from your computer manufacturer will be reinstalled.

 1) If you choose to refresh your Windows 10, choose**Refresh your PC** option. Then choose**Keep my files** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_58ad0bd42c7cf.jpg)

2) If prompt, click on the account you want to provide credentials for.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_58ad0c2d383b7.jpg)

3) Press the **Reset**  button to confirm the reset process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 It will take a while for the refresh to start and to finish. Your computer will restart a few times during the process.

 You need to sign into Windows 10 when the refresh finishes. You will go through first start up again before seeing the desktop after the refresh.
