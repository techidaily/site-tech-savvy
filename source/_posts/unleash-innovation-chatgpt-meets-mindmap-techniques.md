 Brainstorming is an essential part of ideation for any task or project, but it's not always easy to get started. This is where visualization and creative tools such as mind maps can come in useful.

 Not only this, but we now have ChatGPT, an AI-based tool in place as well, which can help with ideating more quickly and effectively when it comes to simplifying complex concepts or coming up with responses and outlines faster.

 Here, we'll walk you through how to use these tools to take your brainstorming sessions up a notch.

## What Is ChatGPT? How Do You Use It to Brainstorm Ideas?

 ChatGPT is a powerful tool developed by Open AI and is based on natural language processing technology to assist with answering queries on a vast range of topics. [You can use ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-by-openai/) to brainstorm your ideas with the help of its extensive knowledge base.

 This AI tool can provide information on a wide range of subjects. You can also ask it for more insightful questions and provide suggestions based on your responses. As you continue to use the tool, it will learn your preferences and adjust its responses accordingly, saving you time and effort.

 Its ability to analyze data and think outside the box makes it a handy tool for brainstorming ideas and successfully bringing them to life. So, let's look at how you can use a mind map and ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas.

## 1\. Write Out Your Goals

 A mind map is a great way to kick-start the brainstorming process. It gives you a visual representation of your thought process and helps you get organized. To get started, write your goal and objectives using a note-taking app or a SMART goal template by [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) or similar.

 Alternatively, you may [use Google Sheets to track and organize your goals](https://www.makeuseof.com/set-track-goals-in-google-sheets/). Write them down in as much detail as possible—this will help you manage your thoughts and keep everything in check when it's time to build your mind map. Then divide this into categories or branches or keywords as required.

![Set project goals with the SMART goals worksheet template](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AnyConvcom__Resized_Vertex42_SMART-Goals.jpeg)

Smart Goals Template

 Write down your main topic, such as "productivity." Next, decide on keywords or categories representing each branch's key concepts.

 For instance, if you're brainstorming on productivity as an idea, consider using keywords like "productivity tips for remote teams," or "productivity tools," etc., so that each branch has a clear focus and doesn't get too broad or general, and note it down on the sheet.

## 2\. Use Mind Map Templates or Tools

 As noted earlier, [mind maps can exponentially increase productivity](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-use-mind-mapping-technique-exponential-productivity/) by visually representing information. But they can be daunting to create on your own. One such way to do so would be to use mind-mapping templates. You can visually organize your thoughts and ideas and approach projects more strategically.

 One of the tools you can use is [Taskade's mind map generator](https://www.taskade.com/templates/ai/mind-map-generator). To get started, simply sign up for an account, and go to **Home > Create with AI > Mind Map for...**

![Taskade AI prompt generator](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taskade1-2-1.jpg)

 Similarly, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/mind-maps/templates/) also offers several templates for creating mind maps using different colors, fonts, and shapes. These templates make it easy to create connections and view relationships between different ideas. Not only that, you can add notes of your own and follow a well-defined structure.

## 3\. Use Detailed Text Prompts in ChatGPT

 If you're using ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, you'll need to enter detailed text prompts to provide context and structure to your thoughts.

 For instance, you can enter a general or specific query—like, "Steps to manage workflow for remote teams or freelancers engaged in multiple projects?" as outlined in the example below. ChatGPT will generate an outline based on your prompt and highlight key points.

 Such an approach can lead to a more thoughtful and creative exploration of ideas rather than a scattershot approach that may result in a jumble of disconnected concepts.

## 4\. Ask ChatGPT for Freestyle Suggestions and Improvised Responses

 If you're stuck on what to brainstorm, you can ask ChatGPT to improvise and develop new ideas and conversation topics without detailed prompts. This approach might just help you land some unexpected insights and creative solutions.

![improvement suggestions for resume from ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/improvement-suggestions.jpg)

 Try specific prompts like "What should I do next after X process ?" or "Can you give me a suggestion on X?" ChatGPT will respond with unique and creative ideas.

 You can also ask, "What if we switched to producing Product X instead of Product Y?". Additionally, ask ChatGPT for freestyle suggestions to help build a more engaging conversation, and you can have unique and diverse perspectives on a topic.

## 5\. Review, Refine, and Expand Your Ideas

 ChatGPT can help you brainstorm with your team, refine your ideas, and expand on them using AI-generated insights.

![person writing a mind map on a whiteboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/person-writing-a-mind-map-on-a-whiteboard.jpg)

1. First, select a specific sub-topic or idea from the list of initial responses generated.
2. Enter a relevant prompt or question into ChatGPT based on the sub-topic to get further responses, lists, or ideas.
3. Use these AI-generated texts or prompts to continue expanding and refuting associated concepts.

 Keep repeating the process until you have a fully fleshed-out idea.

## 6\. Use Mind-Mapping Apps for Your Brainstorming Sessions

 You can combine ChatGPT prompts with a high-quality mind-mapping app such as Miro to create a comprehensive and well-structured workflow or structure.

 Miro is one of the best mind-mapping tools for its ease of use and offers a comprehensive repertoire of interactive and skeuomorphic elements. It doesn't have much of a learning curve—you can easily [learn how to use Miro](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-miro/), which offers you a powerful yet flexible platform for brainstorming, organizing ideas, and collaborating with your team members.
