## The Handyman Awakens with AI Breakthrough

 Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, and OpenAI's GPT-4 is set to be the next big thing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The text generation language model’s current version, GPT-3.5, has surpassed people’s expectations with conversational capabilities ranging from chat companionship to code generation.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

## Multi-Modal AI and DIY: What Is a Multi-Modal AI?

![An electric bulb on a black chalkboard with chat bubbles](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bulb-on-chalkboard.jpg)

 Multi-modal AI refers to AI models that can process and understand different types of data, such as text, images, and videos. Get this, if GPT-4 becomes a multi-modal AI, it will be a game changer for DIY enthusiasts.

 This means that GPT-4 could potentially generate DIY project ideas based on visual input, such as a user's uploaded images of materials or finished projects.

 It could also provide step-by-step instructions that incorporate both text and visual cues, making it easier for users to follow along. With multi-modal capabilities, GPT-4 could open up a whole new world of possibilities for DIY enthusiasts looking to take on more complex projects.

### Integration of Machine-Learning Algorithms

 Integrating algorithms can improve model response relevance and accuracy, leading to personalized DIY recommendations based on user behavior. ML algorithms can recognize DIY-related keywords and tailor user-specific responses, easing the product research and development process.

## The Future of Microcontroller-Based Platforms

![A white robot assistant with a tablet with user interface attached to the chest](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/white-robot-assistant.jpg)

 Microcontroller-based platforms could benefit greatly from advancements in AI models such as ChatGPT4\. Integrating these models can expand the processing power and memory of the platforms, leading to more accurate data analysis from embedded and IoT systems. Speaking of this, we've covered many [Arduino IoT projects](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-arduino-iot-projects/) you can try without waiting for GPT advancements.

 Predictive maintenance measures could also be developed using this data. In the future, lightweight AI versions could even be integrated into devices for DIY projects using compression techniques. Generally, DIY partakers will soon be able to efficiently ideate, research, implement, and modify projects.
