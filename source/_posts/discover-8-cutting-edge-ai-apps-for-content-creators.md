![ChatGPT generating an article outline.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chat-gpt-article-outline.jpg)

 ChatGPT has been one of the biggest successes of the AI generation. You can use this AI textbot as a tool for your writing, but it comes in handy as a fantastic idea generator.

 If you pride yourself as a content writer, you shouldn’t use ChatGPT to write your content, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be used in other ways. Content creators need a steady flow of new ideas, and sometimes your mind is blank.

 Ask ChatGPT for some writing ideas within your content niche, and then use your writing expertise to expand upon the results. You can also [train ChatGPT to write like you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/) to reflect your personal style.
