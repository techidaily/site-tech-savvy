This can happen for several reasons, including lack of context, limitations in training data, or architecture.

## 16\. Hyperparameters

 Hyperparameters are settings that define how an algorithm or a machine learning model learns and behaves. Hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, and the number of hidden layers in the network. You can tinker with these parameters to fine-tune the model's performance according to your needs.

## 17\. Large Language Model (LLM)

 An LLM is a machine learning model trained on vast amounts of data and uses supervised learning to produce the next token in a given context to produce meaningful, contextual responses to user inputs. The word "large" indicates the use of extensive parameters by the language model. For example, [GPT models use hundreds of billions of parameters](http://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-models-explained-and-compared/) to carry out a wide range of NLP tasks.

## 18\. Machine Learning

[Machine learning](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/machine-learning-algorithms/) is a way for machines to learn and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It's like feeding a computer with data and empowering it to make decisions or predictions by identifying patterns within the data.

[AI hallucination](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-hallucination-and-how-do-you-spot-it/) refers to the instances where a model produces factually incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical results. This can happen for several reasons, including lack of context, limitations in training data, or architecture.

## 16\. Hyperparameters

 Hyperparameters are settings that define how an algorithm or a machine learning model learns and behaves. Hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, and the number of hidden layers in the network. You can tinker with these parameters to fine-tune the model's performance according to your needs.

## 17\. Large Language Model (LLM)

 An LLM is a machine learning model trained on vast amounts of data and uses supervised learning to produce the next token in a given context to produce meaningful, contextual responses to user inputs. The word "large" indicates the use of extensive parameters by the language model. For example, [GPT models use hundreds of billions of parameters](http://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-models-explained-and-compared/) to carry out a wide range of NLP tasks.

## 18\. Machine Learning
