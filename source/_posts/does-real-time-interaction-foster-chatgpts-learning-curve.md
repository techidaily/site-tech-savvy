## Does Real-Time Interaction Foster ChatGPT's Learning Curve?

 With millions of ChatGPT users, you might wonder what OpenAI does with all its conversations. Does it constantly analyze the things you talk about with ChatGPT?

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

## Does ChatGPT Remember Conversations?

 ChatGPT doesn't take prompts at face value. It uses contextual memory to remember and reference previous inputs, ensuring relevant, consistent responses.

 Take the below conversation as an example. When we asked ChatGPT for recipe ideas, it considered our previous message about peanut allergies.

![Telling ChatGPT About Food Allergies](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-allergy-prompt.jpg)

 Here's ChatGPT's safe recipe.

![ChatGPT Provides a Flour-Free Cake Recipe](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-safe-cake-recipe.jpg)

 Contextual memory also lets AI execute multi-step tasks. The below image shows ChatGPT staying in character even after feeding it a new prompt.

![Requesting ChatGPT to Roleplay as Ash from Pokemon](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-roleplay-as-ash.jpg)

 ChatGPT can remember dozens of instructions within conversations. Its output actually improves in accuracy and precision as you provide more context. Just ensure you explain your instructions explicitly.

 You should also manage your expectations because ChatGPT's contextual memory still has limitations.

## ChatGPT Conversations Have Limited Memory Capacities

 Contextual memory is finite. ChatGPT has limited hardware resources, so it only remembers up to specific points of current conversations. The platform forgets earlier prompts once you hit its memory capacity.

 In this conversation, we instructed ChatGPT to roleplay a fictional character named Tomie.

![Successfully Asking ChatGPT to Portray Manga Character Tomie](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-roleplay-as-tomie.jpg)

 It started answering prompts as Tomie, not ChatGPT.

![ChatGPT Answering Health Questions as Tomie the Character](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-answering-as-tomie-the-character.jpg)

 Although our request worked, ChatGPT broke character after receiving a 1,000-word prompt.

![ChatGPT Overrides Previous Prompts by Feeding it New Prompts](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-override-previous-prompts.jpg)

 OpenAI has never disclosed ChatGPT's exact limits, but rumors say it can only process 3,000 words at a time. In our experiment, ChatGPT malfunctioned after just 2,800+ words.

 You can break down your prompts into two 1,500-word sets, but ChatGPT likely won't retain all your instructions. Just start another chat altogether. Otherwise, you'll have to repeat specific details several times throughout your conversation.

## ChatGPT Only Remembers Topic-Relevant Inputs

 ChatGPT uses contextual memory to improve output accuracy. It doesn't just retain information for the sake of collecting it. The platform almost automatically forgets irrelevant details, even if you're far from hitting the token limit.

 In the below image, we try to confuse AI with various incoherent, irrelevant instructions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 We kept our combined inputs under 100 words, but ChatGPT still forgot our first instruction. It quickly broke character.

![ChatGPT Forgets Prompts Trying to Retain Irrelevant Information](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-forgets-earlier-prompts.jpg)

 Meanwhile, ChatGPT kept roleplaying during this conversation because we only asked topic-relevant questions.

![ChatGPT Maintains Character Even After Several Questions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-maintaining-character-as-ash.jpg)

 Ideally, each dialogue must follow a singular theme to maintain accurate, relevant outputs. You can still input several instructions simultaneously. Just ensure they align with the overall topic, or else ChatGPT might drop instructions that it deems irrelevant.

## Training Instructions Overpower User Input

 ChatGPT will always prioritize predetermined instructions over user-generated input. It stops illicit activities through restrictions. The platform rejects any prompt that it deems dangerous or damaging to others.

 Take roleplay requests as examples. Although they override certain limitations on language and phrasing, you can't use them to commit illicit activities.

 Of course, not all restrictions are reasonable. If rigid guidelines make it challenging to execute specific tasks, keep rewriting your prompts. Word choice and tone heavily affect outputs. You can take inspiration from the most [effective, detailed prompts on GitHub](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-chatgpt-prompts-on-github/).

## How Does OpenAI Study User Conversations?

 Contextual memory only applies to your current conversation. ChatGPT's stateless architecture treats conversations as independent instances; it can't reference information from previous ones. Starting new chats always resets the model's state.

 This isn't to say that ChatGPT dumps user conversations instantly. [OpenAI's terms of use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) state that the company collects inputs from non-API consumer services like ChatGPT and Dall-E. You can even ask for copies of your chat history.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 While ChatGPT freely accesses conversations, [OpenAI's privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) prohibits activities that might compromise users. Trainers can only use your data for product research and development.

### Developers Look for Loopholes

 OpenAI sifts through conversations for loopholes. It analyzes instances wherein ChatGPT demonstrates data biases, produces harmful information, or helps commit illicit activities. The platform's ethical guidelines are constantly revamped.

 For instance, the first versions of [ChatGPT openly answered questions about coding malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-used-by-cybercriminals-to-write-malware/) or constructing explosives. These incidents made users feel like [OpenAI has no control over ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-lost-control-chatgpt/). To regain the public's trust, it trained the chatbot to reject any question that might go against its guidelines.

### Trainers Collect and Analyze Data

![Woman Reading Reports on Physical Sheets and Her Computer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/woman-reading-physical-and-digital-reports.jpg)

 ChatGPT uses supervised learning techniques. Although the platform remembers all inputs, it doesn't learn from them in real-time. OpenAI trainers collect and analyze them first. Doing so ensures that ChatGPT never absorbs the harmful, damaging information it receives.

 Supervised learning requires more time and energy than unsupervised techniques. However, leaving AI to analyze input alone has already been proven harmful.

 Take Microsoft Tay as an example—one of the [times machine learning went wrong](https://www.makeuseof.com/examples-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-went-wrong/). Since it constantly analyzed tweets without developer guidance, malicious users eventually trained it to spit racist, stereotypical opinions.

### Developers Constantly Watch Out for Biases

 Several [external factors cause biases in AI](http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-bias/). Unconscious prejudices may arise from differences in training models, dataset errors, and poorly constructed restrictions. You'll spot them in various AI applications.

 Thankfully, ChatGPT has never demonstrated discriminatory or racial biases. Perhaps the worst bias users have noticed is ChatGPT's inclination toward left-wing ideologies, according to a [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2023/02/15/wild-west-chatgpt-has-fundamental-flaw-with-left-bias/) report. The platform more openly writes about liberal than conservative topics.

 To resolve these biases, OpenAI prohibited ChatGPT from providing political insights altogether. It can only answer general facts.

### Moderators Review ChatGPT's Performance

 Users can provide feedback on ChatGPT's output. You'll find the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons on the right side of every response. The former indicates a positive reaction. After hitting the like or dislike button, a window will pop up wherein you can send feedback in your own words.

![Leaving Feedback on ChatGPT Output](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/providing-feedback-on-chatgpt.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The feedback system is helpful. Just give OpenAI some time to sift through the comments. Millions of users comment on ChatGPT regularly—its developers likely prioritize grave instances of biases and harmful output generation.

## Are Your ChatGPT Conversations Safe?

 Considering OpenAI's privacy policies, you can rest assured that your data will remain safe. ChatGPT only uses conversations for data training. Its developers study the collected insights to improve output accuracy and reliability, not steal personal data.

 With that said, no AI system's perfect. ChatGPT isn't inherently biased, but malicious individuals could still exploit its vulnerabilities, e.g., dataset errors, careless training, and security loopholes. For your protection, learn to combat these risks.
