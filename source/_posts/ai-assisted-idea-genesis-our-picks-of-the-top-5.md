[ChatGPT](https://hix.ai/chatgpt) is perhaps the most well-known AI text generator currently available. There’s a good reason that ChatGPT is well-known as well. This AI chatbot is a great option when it comes to simulating conversation on almost any topic. It has even been integrated into Bing and a host of other services.

 ChatGPT can also be used to generate text. If you need inspiration or want to alternate the tone, you can always ask ChatGPT for its thoughts.

 However, it is less specialized than dedicated AI text generators as ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that is great at doing a lot of different things, such as generating ideas and reiterating information.

## Work Smarter, Not Harder

 As you can see, there are plenty of options out there when it comes to AI text generation. These five AI text generators are each great for their own reasons, and all offer free trials. Why not give them a try today?
