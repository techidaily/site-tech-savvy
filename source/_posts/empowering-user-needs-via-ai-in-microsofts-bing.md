## Empowering User Needs via AI in Microsoft's Bing

 Microsoft overhauled Bing in February 2023 by integrating it with OpenAI’s latest AI model. Building on the success of ChatGPT, the new Bing will feature an AI chatbot capable of giving comprehensive answers to complex search queries.

 More importantly, we need to look ahead and decode how our experience with the search engines we’ve acquainted ourselves with for so many years will change in the future.

## What Is the Microsoft Prometheus Model?

 Microsoft has branded Bing and the Edge browser as your AI copilot for the web. Undoubtedly, the new [AI-powered Bing packs some huge upgrades](http://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-bing-gets-chatgpt-ai/) , but it’s essential to understand how they’re made possible.

 Microsoft Prometheus is a specialized artificial intelligence model for superior web searching and querying and is fundamentally based on OpenAI’s GPT3.5 and ChatGPT models. Its capabilities are optimized for rapidly fetching relevant and accurate search results without compromising user safety.

 The Prometheus model powers the new Bing to deliver summarized search results that are more relevant and can even answer composite search queries.

## A New Generation of AI for Web Searching

 As a result of Bing’s AI transition, web searching will fundamentally change. In the near future, we won’t have to explore a list of potentially relevant results aimlessly. Instead, AI chatbots will give us the precise information we need to be styled in a format of your choosing.

 For instance, if you had to do homework for Science class, you’d typically end up querying Google for information related to your topic. The search engine would then return you a list of sites it thinks are relevant to your specific search query, and finally, you’d explore some of the top-ranked sites to get accurate and relevant information.

 On the AI-powered Bing, you can specifically query it to give you a list of important points related to your Science class, and Bing will provide you with precisely that. You won’t have to explore multiple retrieved search results. Instead, you can rest assured that Bing has all the correct answers you need, thanks to its AI-powered search algorithm.

 You can also use Bing as your AI chatbot and query it for simple questions like “What’s the weather going to be like in two weeks?” and even complex queries such as “I enjoyed Coachella, what similar music festivals should I visit?”. If you’re not satisfied with Bing’s answer, you can ask it to refine the response per your needs.

## A New Era for Web Browsers as Well?

 Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are used to surf the web. They allow you to access webpages on the internet, view multimedia content on sites such as YouTube and Netflix, access your email inbox, play games, and more. With all the AI advancements in the web domain, it's crucial to consider the impact it could have on web browsers and how we access the web.

 While we’re certainly still a long way from seeing web browsers go obsolete, but we can expect functional upgrades that make it easy to access AI-powered web searching and content generation. Perhaps other browsers, such as Chrome and Opera, will adopt something similar to Edge’s new AI sidebar.

[Google is expected to release its Bard competitor](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-launching-bard-ai-compete-with-chatgpt/) to Microsoft’s AI-powered Bing very soon. Once it’s launched and possibly integrated with Google Chrome, we’ll have a better idea of how web browsers will evolve in the coming future.
