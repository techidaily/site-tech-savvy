 ChatGPT gives you the option to export your account data. This includes your profile information, conversations, and prompts. [Export your ChatGPT data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-export-chatgpt-data/) before deleting your account, just in case you want to use it again or access some conversations later.

 And that's it! You have successfully deleted your ChatGPT account.
