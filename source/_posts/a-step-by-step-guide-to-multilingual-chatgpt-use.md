The tool makes use of advanced linguistic capabilities to detect, translate, and respond in more than 95 languages. Here’s how ChatGPT is able to offer you multilingual support:

* First, ChatGPT uses its language-processing features to identify the language you’ve used in your question/prompt.
* It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the intent and emotion behind the text.
* ChatGPT’s answer is translated into English or your preferred language before replying to you.
