## Transforming the Way You Read Books with These Cutting-Edge Apps and Sites

 Can ChatGPT find the best next book that you will love to read? These AI-powered book recommendation engines take your detailed prompts or deduce your preferred tastes to suggest the perfect page-turner for you.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

## 1\. Find Your Next Book

![Find Your Next Book gives you book recommendations based on your ChatGPT prompts](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-book-recommendation-sites-chatgpt-find-your-next-book.jpg)

 Find Your Next Book (FYNB) calls it an AI-powered librarian. The bot, based on OpenAI, has "read" a large database of books and can now recommend what you should read based on any query. It processes natural language and urges you to specify your queries in detail. So rather than writing something like "a murder mystery," [write an effective ChatGPT prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/) like "a murder mystery set in the future but not in a dystopian world."

 FYNB will take a few minutes to process your request and then give you one recommendation at a time. The recommendation page includes a summary of why the AI thinks the book's topics match what you are looking to read, as well as a non-AI-generated description of the book, like what you're likely to find on the back cover. If you aren't happy with the result, click the "Next Book" button for another recommendation with the same prompt.

## 2\. Sona

![Sona is an AI book recommendation engine by the makers of Read This Twice that makes AI prompt results easy to read](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-book-recommendation-sites-chatgpt-read-this-twice-sona.jpg)

 Sona is a "book-loving AI assistant" from one of our [favorite new book recommendation sites](https://www.makeuseof.com/new-book-recommendation-apps-sites/), Read This Twice. Read This Twice collects which titles celebrities and influential personalities have said everyone should read, with rankings for the most commonly recommended reads.

 You can write long and specific prompts, and Sona's recommendations improve if you add more details about what you're looking for. The results are a long scroll with two columns of recommendations, showing you the book cover, title, author, and description. Among the AI-powered book recommendation apps, it's the quickest way to browse the many suggested titles.

 However, in the results, Sona disappointingly doesn't rely on Read This Twice's core expertise by showing which books are recommended by someone influential. There is a workaround to that, though. If you register on the site, you'll be able to add these books to your personal library and go there to see who has promoted the book.

## 3\. Next Three Books

![Next Three Books suggests three titles from a ChatGPT prompt, and lets you filter results by genre, writing style, length, and type of book](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-book-recommendation-sites-chatgpt-next-three-books.jpg)

 Developer Anukrit Jain believes that when someone is looking for a book recommendation, it's not helpful to overwhelm them with too many choices. Instead, having three choices gives you a balance of variety and simplicity. That's what you get from Next Three Books and its AI-powered book suggestions.

 Before you write a prompt for the AI, you'll first need to choose a few things:

* **Type of book:** Business, self-help, biography, or novel
* **Genre:** Mystery, romance, fantasy, horror, science fiction, historical fiction, or crime
* **Length:** Short, medium, long, or any length
* **Writing style:** Lighthearted, suspenseful, whimsical, dark, poetic, imaginative, or action-packed

 In the prompt, Next Three Books allows you to be a little different from other AI-powered book recommendation engines. It wants you to share your favorite books and even personal details such as age, profession, or industry.

 Once it analyzes your input, the results are three simple cards that include the book title, author's name, and a two-line description. If the book was recommended by someone famous or another author, Next Three Books will add that context to the card.

## 4\. Readow

![Readow uses AI to recommend books based on what you've liked in the past](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-book-recommendation-sites-chatgpt-readow.jpg)

 Most AI-powered book recommendation sites want to use the power of ChatGPT to let you write a simple sentence about what you're looking for, just like you would ask a friend. But figuring out the right prompt can be difficult if you're not used to this. If you're struggling with the other apps, try Readow.

 Readow simply wants you to tell its AI what your favorite books are, and it'll start suggesting recommendations based on your preferences. There is no limit on how many books you can add; in fact, the more books you add, the better it understands your taste and suggests results accordingly.

 Whenever you add or remove a personal favorite, Readow will update the results with 30 book recommendations. You can like books from the recommendations to add them to your favorites or delete them from the recommendations to indicate to the AI that it shouldn't suggest similar titles.

## 5\. BooksAI

 BooksAI isn't a book recommendation engine, but is an invaluable tool for finding a book you'll like to read. If you've used any of the above sites and are intrigued by a title, search for it on BooksAI to read an AI-generated summary of its content.

 Unlike many other AI book summarizers powered by ChatGPT, BooksAI has introduced three ways of getting to know what the book is about. First, you can ask the AI to give you a spoiler-free summary that's more detailed than the book jacket but doesn't give out major plot points or twists. If you're fine with spoilers, you can go for the detailed summary or the chapter-wise summary for a breakdown of each chapter.

 BooksAI also gives you these summaries in nine languages and not just English, making it perfect for non-native speakers. The app also has lists of recommended readings from celebrities and influential minds.

## Give Serendipity a Chance

 These AI-powered book recommendation engines can be astonishingly good at figuring out what you would like. But some might feel that this robs us of the experience of walking into a bookstore, picking up a random novel, and discovering an interesting read. Just so you know, you can give that serendipity a chance online too.
