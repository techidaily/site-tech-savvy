## Unleashing Creativity: ChatAI for Storyworlds

 One of the best parts of writing fiction is the opportunity to create a new world from scratch. You can create otherworldly landscapes and give the characters magic. Mythology can exist in your story’s real-time and traditions can help carve the fictional history. It’s an exciting process.

 However, it can also be exhausting to come up with so many components to worldbuilding. That’s why working with ChatGPT can help alleviate that stress and allow you to brainstorm more efficiently.

## What Is Worldbuilding?

![Person Reading Book on Bench](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/person-reading-book-on-bench.jpg)

 Worldbuilding is exactly as it sounds—it is creating a new world from the ground up. As a writer with the desire to create fictional and fantastical stories, forming a new world is one of the most original ways to do it.

 The overall purpose of worldbuilding is to immerse the reader to feel as if they’re experiencing the world themselves. Think of when you first read Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings—there were moments when you were so encapsulated by the world, you nearly forgot they weren’t real places.

 That immersion is an aspect of [the art of storytelling—another craft ChatGPT can assist with](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-how-to-master-storytelling/). There are several elements that are needed to help build a captivating world. The more you build, the more entrancing your story will become.

## How to Use ChatGPT to Develop the Elements of Worldbuilding

 There are [various ways ChatGPT can be used for creative writing](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-creative-writing/)—it truly is a versatile tool. Because worldbuilding can be a highly time-consuming process, why not try to use AI to help you? However, keep in mind that [using ChatGPT for creative writing does come with its pros and cons](https://www.makeuseof.com/using-chatgpt-for-creative-writing-pros-cons/).

 In this article, we’re going to go along with the first idea and see what new world ChatGPT creates.

### Establish the Premise

 It’s important to set a basis with ChatGPT before asking it any questions. This will allow the AI to understand that the questions afterward are corresponding with each other.

![Setting the premise of worldbuilding with ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-worldbuilding-set-the-premise.jpeg)

 Make sure to open a new chat before starting.

### Build the Setting

 The setting should consist of the physical environment. This can mean any geographical elements, climate, and specific locations. Will your story be land-based or under the ocean? Is it always storming? Are there any mountains of doom, or is the city life serene?

 ChatGPT can also figure out the time period. Even if it’s based on ancient times and there’s modern technology, it’s still an important factor to know.

### Establish a History

 Think of how history has affected the world around you. The history in your fictional world is equally important—it helps to form a culture and gives reason for conflict.

 ChatGPT will give you a breakdown of the fictional world’s history in eras to help you decide how best to incorporate it into your storyline.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Construct the Culture of Society

 Understanding the culture of the society within your fictional world is essential. There needs to be a reason why your characters behave the way they do. What are their religion, art, values, and traditions?

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 ChatGPT will give you ideas for several cultural aspects of what makes up the fictional society.

### Determine Technology and Magic Usage

 Technology and magic are important components for building a world. However, that doesn’t mean that there has to be magic or that technology has to be exceptionally advanced.

 Imagine reading a fantasy novel without either—it would just be some characters walking around with sticks ignoring the invention of the wheel. That doesn’t quite work when the goal is to immerse the reader.

![ChatGPT worldbuilding culture options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-worldbuilding-culture.jpeg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Ask ChatGPT if it can produce some ideas about the uses of technology and magic if it’s available in the fictional world. It’ll give you several concepts that you may miss if you weren’t using the AI.

### Create the Characters

 Asking ChatGPT to create the characters can be tricky because the request has to be highly specific. This is because character types and character races are two different concepts.

![ChatGPT choosing worldbuilding character types](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-worldbuilding-character-types.jpeg)

 Requesting that it pick out character types will give you several ideas of individual characters. On the other hand, if you ask for character races, you’ll get a list of different character groups that aren’t assigned to one specific person or creature.

![ChatGPT choosing worldbuilding character races](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-worldbuilding-character-races.jpeg)

 However, you can ask the AI to create both if you want a more well-rounded understanding.

### Form the Economy

 Civilizations need an economy for structure and to help establish social roles and classes.

![ChatGPT choosing worldbuilding economics](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-worldbuilding-economy.jpeg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 However, it’s vital that you consider the setting with the economy. You can’t have an ocean trade route with ships when your setting is on a rocky, waterless planet.

### Develop Conflict and Politics

 Every story has to have conflict to keep readers engaged, and incorporating conflict based on the fictional world is one of the best ways to do it. If you’ve already got the history figured out, many times conflict and the political system, rivalries included, will stem from that element.

![ChatGPT choosing worldbuilding conflict](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-worldbuilding-conflict.jpeg)

 When you ask ChatGPT, make sure to state that you’re looking for current conflicts and politics. If not, you’ll end up with a whole history lesson about your fictional world’s past affairs.

### Fabricate Legends and Folklore

 Many times, these fantasy-style tales have legends and folklore that help to drive the story. They also help with character development and even history.

 It doesn’t always have to be a driving point in your fictional world, but it does help make it more enthralling for your reader.

## ChatGPT’s Worldbuilding Results

 Below are ChatGPT’s results. Does this seem like a world you’d be able to immerse yourself in?

* **Setting**: ChatGPT chose to go with a magical wilderness theme. This includes enchanted forests, rivers and waterfalls, mountains, and caves. It’s a world where magic and nature are linked together.
* **History**: This fictional world starts with untamed magic. A force comes in to merge with the magic and build a great civilization from within it. There was war and the magic weakened. After some time of instability, civilization tried to find unity. Within that, more dark forces awaken.
* **Culture and Society**: Society believes the Devine to be in nature, the importance of harmony among the four elements, and communal living among the people. There is also the existence of wise guardians who hang out in libraries and other sanctuaries guarding scrolls and traditions.
* **Technology and Magic**: Magic is used in everyday life, it is entwined with tools to assist with chores. There is also teleportation and magical creatures for travel. There’s limited technology that works with magic instead of replacing it. Characters can use magic to harness the elements; alchemy and restoration magic are used.
* **Characters**: Some character types include the elemental mage, the ancient seer, and the shape-shifting druid. Some character races include elves, dwarves, humans, shifters, and centaurs.
* **Economy**: The economy is set around natural resources and magical items. There is the trading of these items for money and harvesting of magical resources like crystals and herbs.
* **Conflict and Politics**: Due to rivalries, the Rift Wars are underway. A powerful force wants to capture the untamed magic still available from the previous eras and break down the barrier between worlds.
* **Legends and Folklore**: The Legend of the Celestial Nexus is about the origins of the magic within the wilderness.
