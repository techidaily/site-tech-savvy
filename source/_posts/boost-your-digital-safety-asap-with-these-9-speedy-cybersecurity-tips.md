## Boost Your Digital Safety ASAP with These 9 Speedy Cybersecurity Tips!

Cybersecurity can be a complicated topic, but it's a necessary one. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to hire a professional or be a tech whiz to protect your PC from hackers. In reality, simple steps that take just 5-10 minutes to implement can offer all the practical protection most users need.

## 1  Install a Password Manager 

 Ideally, each of your passwords should be long, complex, and unique to each account. This approach makes them difficult to crack and limits damage if one account is compromised.

 However, this can quickly become a problem when you need to keep track of dozens, if not hundreds, of complex passwords. For context, I have 300 user accounts on different websites, all with unique passwords that are 20-character long random alphanumeric strings.

 To help keep all this organized, we have password managers—tools that auto-generate and securely store unique passwords for all your digital accounts. Each time you access an account, the password manager will fill out your username and password.

 You only need to remember one master password, and the manager takes care of the rest. You just need to be sure to [create the most secure master password](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/crafting-authenticity-in-client-testimonial-videos-for-2024/) you can.

 I personally use [Bitwarden](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-seamless-text-integration-on-pc-and-mac-systems-for-2024/) as my password manager of choice, but there are [other options available](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-facebook-video-ads-with-free-video-creation-kit-for-2024/). Overall, this should be the first, most basic step you take to improve your cybersecurity. It's quick to set up and extremely useful in protecting your online presence.

## 2  Enable Two-Factor Authentication 

![Authenticator apps on phone](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2-authenticator-apps-on-phone.png) 

 While protecting your accounts with strong passwords is crucial, you should also be aware that as technology progresses, these passwords will become easier and [easier to crack](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tomorrows-quantum-computers-threaten-todays-secrets-heres-how-to-protect-them-2/).

 As such, to add an extra layer of protection, you should [enable two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-premiere-visionary-film-glimpses/) on all your accounts that support it. This ensures that even if someone cracks your password, they still can’t get in without an additional authentication code.

 Typically, 2FA involves receiving a code via SMS or an authenticator app. While SMS is better than nothing, I'd recommend using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy for added security. It takes just a few minutes to set up, and it's one of the most effective ways to protect your accounts.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  Use Hardware Security Keys

![The Yubico Yubikey 5CI laying on a notebook](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-yubico-yubikey-5ci-laying-on-a-notebookjpg_52637983037_o.jpg) 

_Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek_

 If you want to take your 2FA game to the next level, consider using [hardware security keys, otherwise known as USB security keys](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/discover-chatgpts-latest-updates-and-key-features-enhancing-your-experience/). These are physical devices that you plug into your computer or phone to verify your identity. They're incredibly secure and virtually impossible to hack remotely.

 YubiKeys are the gold standard here, and I’d personally recommend the [Yubico YubiKey 5 NFC](https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/), as that’s the one I use myself. That said, there are [other options available on the market](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-photography-choices-for-sharpest-4k-reflections/) that you can look into and pick the one that best suits your needs and requirements.

## 3  Regularly Update Your Apps and Operating System 

![Windows 11 Updated](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3-windows-11-updated.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 All of our apps and even the operating systems we use have bugs and vulnerabilities—it’s just the world we live in. Developers are constantly searching for these weak points and releasing updates with bug fixes to prevent hackers from exploiting these vulnerabilities.

 As such, it’s crucial that you routinely update your apps and operating system (OS) to access all the latest security patches. Ideally, automatic updates are the most convenient option, but it can sometimes be a problem, especially if an app or the OS decides to update itself in the middle of your work.

 If you find automatic updates problematic, you can manually update your apps. Windows users can [disable automatic updates](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/boost-your-pcs-gameplay-download-the-new-steelseries-engine-for-windows-11-enthusiasts/) and switch to manual updates.

 However you do it, automatically or manually, remember to regularly update your system to enhance your cybersecurity.

## 4  Enable Full-Disk Encryption

 This option might not be that useful for desktop PC owners, but it’s a must-have for portable devices like laptops or smartphones. This is because small portable devices have a higher chance of getting stolen. And you don’t want the thief to have access to your personal files, photos, and other sensitive information, do you?

 Most modern operating systems offer [built-in encryption tools](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/15-best-strongest-pokemon-to-use-in-pokemon-go-pvp-leagues-for-motorola-g54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/): on Windows, it's called BitLocker, on macOS, it's FileVault, and on Linux, you can use LUKS. There are also third-party options, like VeraCrypt, that can be used to [encrypt your drives on most major operating systems.](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-exploring-platform-variations-youtube-vs-dailymention-for-2024/)

## 5  Use a VPN, Especially When Accessing Public Wi-Fi 

![proton vpn running on phone](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/proton-vpn-running-on-phone.jpg) 

[Proton](https://drive.proton.me/urls/5VFT9FFVYR#QCPVhP5DJgPd)

 If you are someone who uses public Wi-Fi a lot, you should [definitely consider investing in a Virtual Private Network](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-listenleads-whats-better-than-dacast/) (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic. Without a VPN, other users (e.g., hackers) on public Wi-Fi can potentially snoop into your online activities and see what you are doing.

 Now, there are dozens of VPN service providers, and picking the [perfect VPN for your needs and budget](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-ffmpeg-audioscape-maintaining-original-audio-formats/) can be a bit daunting. Personally, I subscribe to [Mullvad VPN](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/windows-11-audio-upgrade-how-to-elevate-speaker-volume-with-ease/) because it’s one of the most secure options, albeit a bit pricey.

## 6  Set Up a Secure DNS Server

 Without getting too technical, by default, your internet service provider (ISP) handles all your[Domain Name System (DNS) requests](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-tips-for-ios-screen-record/). This means your ISP can see every website you are trying to visit—and potentially, can even sell your browsing data. If you don’t want prying eyes over your internet traffic, you should consider [switching to a more secure DNS server](https://common-error.techidaily.com/fixing-network-issues-a-guide-to-dealing-with-unavailable-dhcp-servers/).

 I personally use [Cloudflare 1.1.1.1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/), which is known for its speed and privacy. Alternatively, you can switch to [OpenDNS or Google DNS](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-vivo-y100a-phone-by-drfone-android/), both of which are great options.

## 7  Enable Login Alerts 

![Robber running away after door alarm goes off](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6-robber-running-away-after-door-alarm-goes-off.png) 

Dibakar Ghosh / How-To Geek | Midjourney

 Most major online services offer the option to receive alerts when someone logs into your account from a new device or location. When enabled, you’ll get an email notification alerting you that someone just logged into your account, along with some useful information, like the IP address and login device.

![Bitwarden Login Attempt Alert](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-bitwarden-login-attempt-alert-1.png)

It's fast, runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, comes with a cover design editor, and allows book variations to be created with alternate text, style sheets and cover designs. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 You could ignore this email if you (or someone you allowed) logged in. However, if you find the activity suspicious and don’t know who made the login, you can deauthorize the device or IP from your account, and then quickly change your password to protect your account.

## 8  Take Routine Backups (Consider Cloud Backups Wisely) 

![A laptop with a USB drive and an external hard drive next to it and a backup icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-laptop-with-a-usb-drive-and-an-external-hard-drive-next-to-it-and-a-backup-icon.jpg)

 One of the major security threats is [ransomware attacks](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-changing-video-pace-on-your-instagram-feed/), where a hacker or virus will lock all data on your system, then threaten to delete everything unless you pay the “ransom”.

 While prevention is the best cure—which you can do by avoiding downloading software from suspicious websites and keeping apps and software up to date—you also need to have a backup plan, literally.

 My PC is set to automatically back up all data every week. At a minimum, you should always [keep a backup of all your important files](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/explore-petcubes-affordable-high-responsive-pet-monitor/). 

## 9  Use a Webcam Cover 

![Webcam with privacy shutter](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8-webcam-with-privacy-shutter.jpg) 

Dibakar Ghosh / How-To Geek 

[Webcam hacking](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-icloud-by-checkra1n-even-on-iphone-14-pro-max-if-youve-tried-everything-by-drfone-ios/) is a real thing, and even Mark Zuckerberg covers his webcam. A simple sliding webcam cover is cheap, easy to use, and gives you peace of mind.

 If you’re using a desktop, like I am, consider getting a webcam with a built-in privacy shutter. That isn't an option if you use a laptop with a built-in camera, but you can find [plenty of slim, attractive webcam covers](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-ispoofer-alternative-to-try-on-honor-90-gt-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) that won't interfere with closing your laptop.

The internet can be a dangerous place, but with these precautions, you're well on your way to a safer online experience.
