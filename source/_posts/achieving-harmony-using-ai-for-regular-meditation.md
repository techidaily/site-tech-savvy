## 1\. Prepare Yourself for Meditation With ChatGPT

 Often, the most difficult part of meditation for many people is simply getting started. Because people generally live with such busy schedules, taking time out for the practice can feel indulgent. But if you do, you’ll quickly feel the benefit.

 Of course, there are many [ways to get started with meditation](https://www.makeuseof.com/meditation-how-to-get-started/). ChatGPT will lead you through the practice, but your first step is to set up a safe space without distractions. You might not need help with this, but it could be your first interaction with ChatGPT. When I asked, “Can you recommend how to set up a quiet space for a meditation session?” I received a list of 12 great ideas to set the scene.

## 2\. Ask ChatGPT Initial Questions About Meditation

 A great way to familiarize yourself with ChatGPT is to ask questions about any aspects of meditation that you want to learn more about. For example, you could use prompts such as:

* How can beginners develop a regular meditation practice?
* What are the different types of meditation, and which one is best for me?
* How can meditation help me achieve a state of mindfulness?

 And if you’re not entirely convinced of the benefits of meditation, ask ChatGPT:

* What are the benefits of meditation for my mental health?
* How can meditation improve my focus and concentration?
* What are the physical benefits of a regular meditation practice?

 You can ask more specific questions to get more tailored answers, for example, by outlining any medical conditions you have and asking how ChatGPT can help you.

 Of course, you must exercise caution when interacting with ChatGPT about such issues. When I asked about depression and meditation, the first line of the ChatGPT answer was, “I'm not a mental health professional, but I can provide some general information about the potential benefits of meditation for mental health.” Here’s [how to fact-check health information from ChatGPT and AI sources](https://www.makeuseof.com/fact-check-health-information-chatgpt-ai-sources/).

## 3\. Use ChatGPT to Help Identify Your Intentions for the Meditation Session

 You’ll get more from your meditation session if you define an intention, or aim, for your practice. Use ChatGPT to help suggest suitable intentions.

 I asked the simple question, “Can you suggest a meditation intention for this session?” and the answer was “self-compassion and inner peace.” ChatGPT generated a list of seven ways I could use this in my session.

 Try to frame your intentions positively, with statements such as:

* I aim to find inner joy.
* I intend to calm my mind and relax.

 It can be helpful to write down any useful suggestions you receive for future reference.

## 4\. Start Your Meditation Session Using ChatGPT

 Now that you have defined your intentions, direct ChatGPT to prompt your meditation session in a way that reflects your needs. Use prompts like:

* What are some meditation techniques to relieve my anxiety?
* What are some techniques to cultivate peace of mind?
* I'm feeling overwhelmed. Can you give me some meditation techniques?

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Because ChatGPT is a text-based service, it won’t lead you through a session as you would expect from a [meditation app like Insight Timer](https://www.makeuseof.com/deep-dive-into-insight-timer-meditation-app/), the [meditation and mindfulness app Calm](https://www.makeuseof.com/meditating-calm-app-improve-mindfulness/), or even a teacher. Instead, you’ll receive a list of ideas to work with, and you can consider which approaches might work best for you.

## 5\. Reflect Mindfully on Responses and Ask Further Questions for Clarity

 After ChatGPT generates a response and you’ve thought about its ideas, you can converse with the chatbot and ask further questions to gain guidance and insights to suit you better. Learning [how to write effective ChatGPT prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/) will help you get the most out of your interaction with the tool.

 From the list of meditations I received, I asked for further guidance on my favorite suggestion, posing a more specific question: “I like the idea of Loving-Kindness (Metta) Meditation. Can you explain how to practice this in a 10-minute meditation session?” ChatGPT provided a step-by-step timed outline for my whole practice.

## 6\. Apply the ChatGPT Advice in Your Meditation Session

 Practice some of the suggestions, using everything you have learned from your interactions with ChatGPT.

## 7\. Conclude Your Meditation Session With Breathing Exercises

 It’s common to conclude a meditation session with a short breathing exercise to help you return to your ordinary state. There are several [apps with breathing exercises for relaxation](https://www.makeuseof.com/apps-breathing-exercises-relaxation-mindfulness/), but ChatGPT can help with this, too. Simply ask it to suggest some breathing exercises for you, and follow the advice.

 Breathe deeply and take a few moments to return to your ordinary state. You could journal your responses to help you next time.

## 8\. Set Future Goals Using ChatGPT for Guidance

 Hopefully, your meditation session has left you refreshed and eager to make meditation a regular habit. You can interact with ChatGPT to help devise a meditation practice to suit you. Ask questions such as:

* What are the best techniques for meditation while walking?
* What are the best ways to incorporate meditation into your daily routine?
* What are the best meditation apps to use for guided sessions?

 When I asked how to incorporate meditation into my daily routine, ChatGPT came up with a dozen great ideas, including using breaks wisely and incorporating mindful moments into everyday tasks like walking, eating, or washing dishes.

 Of course, you can combine these answers with advice from other sources, such as our list of [meditation apps to help you pause for a mindful moment on the go](https://www.makeuseof.com/meditation-apps-mindful-moment-on-go/).
