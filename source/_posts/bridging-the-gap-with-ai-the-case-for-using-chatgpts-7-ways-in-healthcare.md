## Bridging the Gap with AI: The Case for Using ChatGPT's 7 Ways in Healthcare

 Searching for the best advice on health and wellness can be tough. After all, the amount of information floating around the internet is overwhelming, and not all of it is top-notch. And at the end of the day, who can you trust?

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Enter the AI tool that took the internet by storm: ChatGPT. When used wisely, it can become your new AI-powered health and wellness advisor. Here's why it can be a valuable tool for health and wellness advice and what you should remember about its limitations.

## 1\. ChatGPT Has a Vast Knowledge Base and Up-to-Date Information

 ChatGPT boasts a vast knowledge base, providing you with access to a deep library of health and wellness information.

 ChatGPT can also synthesize all this knowledge in seconds, making it the ultimate research partner. It's like having not only a personal library at your fingertips but also a personal librarian and research assistant, all rolled into one super-smart AI package.

 Because ChatGPT has been trained on so much data, it demonstrates familiarity with a range of topics, from nutrition and exercise to mental health and stress management. Some critics argue that ChatGPT is over-rated or shouldn't be trusted because the current knowledge base is limited to 2021\. However, health and wellness advice released up to 2021 is not necessarily outdated.

 Furthermore, in March 2023, [OpenAI launched plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) that extend the AI bot's functionality to access third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. This means ChatGPT's recommendations could include the very latest research, trends, and expert opinions in the health and wellness sphere.

## 2\. ChatGPT Has Access to Diverse Knowledge Sources

 One of the key strengths of ChatGPT is its access to diverse knowledge sources. It can pull from a wealth of resources, including scientific journals, expert opinions, and reputable health organizations. This ensures that the advice you get is not only diverse but also credible.

 For instance, when you ask ChatGPT about the recommended amount of protein needed to build muscle, it will reference studies published by [Medicine & Science in Sports & Nutrition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19225360/), the [British Journal of Sports Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/), and the [Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-018-0215-1). It will even include citations so that you can find and read the journal articles yourself.

 By providing advice backed by scientific evidence and expert consensus, you can put some degree of trust into the advice and recommendations that ChatGPT provides. While ChatGPT [can provide reliable health information](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-provide-reliable-health-information/), be sure to understand some of its limitations, such as inaccurate responses and hallucinations.

## 3\. ChatGPT Provides Instant Advice Wherever You Are

 Whether you're on your smartphone during a lunch break, at your desktop computer in the office, or lounging with your tablet on a lazy Sunday, ChatGPT is just a few taps or clicks away. Easy accessibility means that you can get the answers you need without delay. You don't have to wait for an appointment with a nutritionist or spend hours browsing through countless articles.

## 4\. ChatGPT Provides Tailored Health and Wellness Advice

 One of the standout features of ChatGPT is its ability to provide tailored responses that cater to your unique needs and circumstances. Instead of presenting generic advice, it takes into account your specific goals and preferences to offer personalized guidance.

 For example, ChatGPT can be used to generate advice on weekly meal plans based on your body type, sex, activity level, age, food preferences, and health goals (whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or something else).

 You could also use ChatGPT to generate workout plans based on your fitness level, goals, and even the type of equipment or time you have available. It may direct you to a [great yoga app](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-yoga-apps-help-workout-anywhere/) or one of [the best workout apps to get in shape](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-workout-apps/).

## 5\. ChatGPT Is Empowering

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 ChatGPT goes beyond just providing information to satiate your curiosity or provide recommendations. By being so easy to use, ChatGPT can be downright empowering by supercharging your self-awareness and understanding of various topics.

 By acting as a personal health and wellness coach that is always around, ChatGPT may be the tool that finally helps you to take responsibility for your health and make more informed choices.

 At the same time, ChatGPT's tailored responses can point out potential blind spots. In the case of health and wellness, this may be the importance of sleep when building muscle, in addition to diet and exercise.

## 6\. ChatGPT Has the Potential to Reduce the Burden on Healthcare Professionals

 As people increasingly turn to ChatGPT for information and guidance on everyday health concerns, it may help alleviate the workload of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers. This is particularly valuable in times of increased demand for medical services, such as during flu seasons or health crises.

 While ChatGPT is not a substitute for professional medical advice and should not be relied upon for diagnosing or treating medical conditions, it can serve as an informative and accessible resource for general health and wellness topics.

## 7\. ChatGPT Is a Gateway to Improving Your Health and Wellness IQ

 It's important to remember that ChatGPT should serve as a starting point for research and information gathering. Just like when you access other information on the internet, you should seek additional sources for validation before making any major decision about your health.

 That said, by engaging with ChatGPT, you'll gain insights into various topics and discover new areas of interest. You can then train the tool to provide further research from reputable sources, such as medical journals, health organizations, and healthcare professionals. This can help you build a more comprehensive understanding and confirm the accuracy of the information provided by ChatGPT.

## Using ChatGPT to Support Your Wellness Journey

 ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile tool that can significantly enhance your knowledge of health and wellness topics, transforming you into an encyclopedia of well-being. With its vast knowledge base, up-to-date information, diverse sources, instant access, and tailored responses, it could be a go-to resource for those seeking health advice.

 Keep in mind that ChatGPT is designed to complement the advice and guidance from healthcare professionals, not replace it—especially for serious conditions. By utilizing ChatGPT alongside consultations with your healthcare providers, you can ensure that you're making the most well-rounded choices for a healthier and happier life.
