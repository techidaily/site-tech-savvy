 If this is the first you've heard of GPT-4 Turbo, it's one of the more advanced AI models at the time of writing. It's designed by OpenAI, the people who invented the [wildly popular ChatGPT service](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/).

 To put GPT-4 Turbo into perspective; when ChatGPT went viral, it was using the 3.5 model. After that, OpenAI released the GPT-4 model, which could handle queries better and sounded more human. Finally, they made the model process faster and thus arrived at GPT-4 Turbo.

 Right now, the best way to use GPT-4 Turbo for free is via Microsoft Copilot. It may seem weird that you have to go through Microsoft instead of OpenAI, but the two companies have a really close relationship. As such, it's not unusual to see OpenAI's features appear within Microsoft's AI assistants.

## How to Use GPT-4 Turbo for Free With Microsoft Copilot

 To get started with GPT-4 Turbo, just boot up Copilot and start talking with it. At the time of writing, Copilot will use GPT-4 Turbo by default when talking to a user on the free tier.

 If you're a Windows 10 or 11 user, there's a very good chance you have a Copilot button on your taskbar. To get started with GPT-4 Turbo, just click this button and begin chatting with the chatbot when it appears.

 If you want to bring Copilot up faster, you can do so by pressing **Win + C**. Or, if you're lucky enough to own a [laptop with a dedicated Copilot button](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsofts-copilot-key-windows-11-pc/), just press that to bring up the assistant at any time.

The app has a toggle when you open it that enables or disables GPT-4\. It may not be the Turbo version, but it should still be powerful enough to handle your queries.
