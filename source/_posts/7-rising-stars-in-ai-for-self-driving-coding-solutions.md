## 7 Rising Stars in AI for Self-Driving Coding Solutions

 ChatGPT is a great AI tool for automatically generating code from human language prompts. However, it’s not focused specifically on code and may not integrate seamlessly into your workflow. Here are several options for more code-focused AI tools.

![github copilot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/github-copilot.jpg)

[GitHub Copilot is an AI assistant](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-github-copilot-helps-you-code/) developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. As you type, it suggests full lines of code for various programming languages. Copilot is trained on the public repositories available on GitHub.

 Some key features of GitHub Copilot are:

* It analyzes your code and suggests code snippets based on context. It can suggest variable names, functions, and entire lines of code.
* It can generate code based on the comments written in natural language.
* It supports programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, PHP, C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Shell.
* It is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of IDEs.

 GitHub Copilot is not free but has a 30-day free trial period. After that, you need to subscribe to an individual or a business plan to use it.

 GitHub has also released [Copilot X](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x) which uses GPT4\. It introduces more AI assistance like generated pull requests, context-aware conversations, automated testing, and command-line AI.

## Should You Rely on Code Generators?

 AI code generators like these are very helpful in reducing the amount of code you write. However, you should not fully rely on them to write entire applications. The code they generate may not always be error-free. It’s important to thoroughly test and review the generated code before integrating it with your production code.

 It’s best to think of code assistants as tools to supplement your own coding knowledge. For instance, rely on them to generate boilerplate code or when you are working with a new programming language or framework and want to learn its syntax.
