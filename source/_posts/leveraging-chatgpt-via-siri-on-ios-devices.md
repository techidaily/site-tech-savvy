 Although ChatGPT doesn't have an official mobile app, you can access its capabilities on your iPhone via Siri. So, if you're already interested, read on as we'll teach you how to use ChatGPT with Siri on your iPhone.

## How Can You Get ChatGPT on Your iPhone?

 It's not as simple as downloading an app from the App Store, but it's definitely not too hard either. If you want to get ChatGPT on your iPhone, you'll have to download a shortcut in the Shortcuts app and paste an API key into it. Sounds complex? Don't worry; we'll walk you through it step by step.

### Getting the OpenAI API Key for ChatGPT

 First and foremost, you will need an OpenAI API key. Follow these steps to get one:

1. Open [platform.openai.com](https://auth0.openai.com/u/login/identifier?state=hKFo2SBrQS1NMU1EMzFMSTNJdTc2RWJialpPX1VOX3NhYUwwTKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIHB1b0dyNk9aazZQMlhvdHo4QXM0SU9YTjRtbzUtc1J6o2NpZNkgRFJpdnNubTJNdTQyVDNLT3BxZHR3QjNOWXZpSFl6d0Q) and register. If you already have an account, log in.
2. Tap on the icon with three horizontal lines at the top-right corner of your screen. A list of options will appear.
3. Scroll down and tap on your profile icon.
4. From the dropdown menu, select **View API keys**.
5. Tap **\+ Create new secret key**, and an API key will be generated.
6. Tap on the **Copy** icon in green and press **OK** to finish.

 Congratulations, you now have your very own ChatGPT shortcut set up on your iPhone. Now for the million-dollar question: how do you use the shortcut with Siri on your iPhone?

## Using the ChatGPT Shortcut With Siri on Your iPhone

 Before we can use Siri to launch the ChatGPT shortcut, we need to ensure the shortcut has permission to function correctly. Tap on your shortcut, and you will be prompted to allow the shortcut to connect to OpenAI. Press **Allow** to give it the necessary permissions. If any of the shortcuts give you additional prompts, like asking you to allow access to **Speech Recognition** or **Enable Diction**, make sure you tap **Allow**.

 Once this is done, you are free to use your shortcuts with Siri, and it's just as easy as giving Siri any other command. All you have to do is say, "Hey Siri, launch SiriGPT" or "Hey Siri, launch ChatGPT 1.2.4," depending on what shortcut you've downloaded, and the chatbot will instantly be at your service. However, if Siri doesn't respond, you can [try these fixes if Hey Siri isn't working on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/hey-siri-not-working-iphone-how-to-fix/).
