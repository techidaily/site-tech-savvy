## Why Professionals Should Prioritize Learning ChatGPT - The 6 Key Points

As new technologies are increasingly incorporated into work, acquiring new tech skills has become crucial for job seekers and workers. One emerging skill that's gaining significant traction is ChatGPT, a generative AI language model developed by OpenAI.ChatGPT is revolutionizing various industries, making it a valuable skill for professionals who want to succeed in the competitive job market. Here are several compelling reasons why you should consider learning ChatGPT.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

## 1\. ChatGPT Is an In-Demand Job Skill

 Professionals adept in ChatGPT have become increasingly in demand. According to HR experts interviewed by [CNBC Make It](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/chatgpt-is-the-newest-in-demand-job-skill-that-can-help-you-get-hired.html), it's the hottest new job skill to get you hired. In fact, 90% of U.S. business leaders consider ChatGPT experience a plus for job seekers, making it a valuable skill.

[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1365145/artificial-intelligence-market-size/) shows that the AI market is poised to grow twentyfold by 2030, with many industries adopting AI. If you're looking to future-proof your career, AI tools like ChatGPT are not only a nice-to-have skill but a must-have.

## 2\. ChatGPT Makes the Job Search Process Easier

 Looking for a job can be overwhelming. Thankfully, there are [practical ways to use ChatGPT in your job search](https://www.makeuseof.com/practical-ways-to-use-chatgpt-job-search/), which can significantly simplify your experience. With ChatGPT, you can practice job interviewing, create tailored resumes and cover letters, prepare for salary negotiations, and identify the best career paths.

 Here's an example of how we used ChatGPT to critique a sample resume. For the Training and Certificates section, the AI tool gave helpful feedback such as "mention any notable insights or projects you worked on during these courses."

![chatGPT resume feedback](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/muo-standard-20.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 However, adapt these suggestions with a critical eye. ChatGPT is prone to hallucinations. It may say something that appears real but doesn't exist in reality.

 Moreover, not everything ChatGPT says may be relevant to your situation. For instance, ChatGPT wants us to mention that we used Figma and Canva to create engaging social media graphics in the Skills section. However, we wanted the skills section to provide recruiters with only a quick snapshot of our skills, not a detailed explanation. We can expound on how we used these tools in the Experience section of the resume instead.

 One of the best things about ChatGPT is its ability to hold human-like conversations. It could act as your career coach so that you can gain insight into your career trajectory. Just remember that while you can learn [how ChatGPT can help you land your dream job](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-help-land-dream-job/), it's only an AI tool. Ultimately, deciding which job or career to take is solely yours.

## 4\. ChatGPT Improves Work Efficiency

 ChatGPT can significantly enhance work efficiency by providing valuable assistance in various tasks. ChatGPT can handle tasks like responding to emails and editing content, allowing you to focus on higher-level thinking and more creative endeavors.

 Edward Tian's experience is a remarkable example of the power of AI. According to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2023/01/17/1149206188/this-22-year-old-is-trying-to-save-us-from-chatgpt-before-it-changes-writing-for), Tian built the GPTZero app to detect AI-written text. To develop his app, he used GitHub Co-Pilot software, which is powered by GPT-3, a similar language model to ChatGPT.

 GPT-3 enabled Tian to develop a new app within three days. This success story shows that with the right knowledge, you can employ AI tools like ChatGPT to innovate quickly.

 You might not have Tian's technical knowledge. But you can [use ChatGPT to enhance your workday productivity](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-chatgpt-enhance-workday-productivity/) in other ways. Here are some ideas:

* **Writing Assistance**: ChatGPT can help generate ideas, suggest alternative phrasings, and offer language corrections.
* **Research**: By providing prompts or specific questions, ChatGPT can assist in retrieving and condensing information from vast amounts of text, making the research process more efficient. For instance, in the photo below, we asked ChatGPT to extract key information from an article on AI creativity published by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/watson/advantage-reports/future-of-artificial-intelligence/ai-creativity.html).

![chatgpt summary of an article written in bullet points](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/muo-standard-19.jpg)

* **Data Analysis and Decision-Making**: By prompting ChatGPT with relevant data sets, you can obtain valuable analysis and recommendations to inform your decision-making process. This can be particularly useful for professionals in fields such as marketing, finance, and strategic planning.
* **Language Translation**: ChatGPT can quickly translate text between languages. This is particularly helpful if you're working with an international team.

## 5\. ChatGPT Sparks Creativity

 While AI models like ChatGPT are not inherently creative, they can spark inspiration and augment your creative process. Use ChatGPT as a source of ideas to help you explore new concepts, experiment with different perspectives, and overcome creative blocks.

 ChatGPT is a powerful tool to generate prompts and help you develop ideas across various domains, such as writing, design, marketing, and more. In this example, we asked ChatGPT for writing prompts to help us with creative writing blocks. It came up with a few fun ideas.

## 6\. ChatGPT Helps You Learn New Skills

 Engaging with ChatGPT and mastering its functionalities can expand your skill set and open doors to continuous learning. By enhancing your proficiency in working with AI tools, you develop transferable skills valuable in many professional contexts.

 A prime example of this is the story of Ihor Stefurak, an entrepreneur featured on [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-i-built-chrome-extension-sold-acquire-thousands-2023-). Despite not being a programmer, Stefurak used ChatGPT to build a Chrome extension, which he later sold for thousands on Acquire. His success showcases that even without prior coding experience, individuals can use ChatGPT to bring their ideas to life.
