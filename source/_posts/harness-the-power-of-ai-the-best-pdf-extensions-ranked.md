## Harness the Power of AI: The Best PDF Extensions Ranked

 Often, we interact with PDFs, relying on their convenience of access. PDFs simplify our interaction with information, from reading novels and e-books to studying and analyzing graphs. But sometimes, it can be hard to work with them.

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 For instance, a PDF can contain hundreds of pages of a scanned physical book, making it difficult to interact with the text. These and many other challenges can be frustrating. Luckily, several AI-powered plugins are available on ChatGPT to save you the hustle.

## 1\. Ai PDF

 Ai PDF is a ChatGPT Plugin designed to streamline the extraction of information from PDF documents with fact-checking capabilities, helping you go through large documents quickly.

 To use it, copy the URL of your document and paste it into ChatGPT with the plugin enabled. You can then instruct it to provide any information you need. You can also generate a summary highlighting the main points of the entire document.
