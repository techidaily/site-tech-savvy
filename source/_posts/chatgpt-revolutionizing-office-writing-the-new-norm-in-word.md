## How to Generate Documents in Word With ChatGPT

 After successfully installing the ChatGPT add-in, you need to provide it with your OpenAI API key for it to work. If you don't already have one, you can create an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.

 The best thing about this ChatGPT add-in is that it doesn't just save you a trip to your browser. It also works based on the context of your document, or selections of your document. With the add-in open, highlight a piece of your document, and you'll see that the prompt box in the add-in says it's using selection as context. You can also use the entire document as context by pressing **Ctrl** \+ **A** on your keyboard to select everything.

 In addition, you can select a piece of the text and ask ChatGPT to write the rest for you. For better output, you can [train ChatGPT to write like you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/) before asking it to generate text.

 Once you get the answer to your prompt, the add-in provides you with the options to **Embed** the reply under the selection, or to **Replace** the selection with the ChatGPT reply.

 The add-in displays a preview of how many tokens your prompt will cost under the prompt box. ChatGPT uses the entire conversation as context, so remember to reset the conversation to avoid exceeding your [ChatGPT token limit](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/).
