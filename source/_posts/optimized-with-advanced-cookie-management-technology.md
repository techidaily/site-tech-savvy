###### Challenge

Looking for a solution that ensures seamless process ﬂow through various stages, integrates business rules, allows double veriﬁcation, and captures data on double-sided pages with highest accuracy.

###### Solution

ABBYY’s Intelligent Document Processing platform integrates with Election Management System for highest speed and accuracy.

###### Results

676k voting papers (color, A3 duplex) processed in a three-week voting period.

#### Challenge

* Existing data capture technology was cumbersome and created blocks in the queue, holding up a highly time sensitive process.
* Need for a content and process intelligence solution that integrates with an existing Oracle based Election Management System.
* The solution must ensure seamless process ﬂow through various stages, integrate business rules, allow double veriﬁcation, and capture data on double-sided pages with the highest level of accuracy.
* Solution architecture must be able to scale based on inﬂux of voter ballots received by mail each day, sometimes in the tens of thousands.
* On-site support is needed as insurance against unforeseen scenarios that could threaten processing and timing of election results within a secure vote processing environment with no network connections available to meet stringent vote processing security requirements.

#### Solution

* ABBYY Intelligent Document Processing platform integrates with the existing Election Management System to create a seamlessly automated processing system that captures voter ballot selections with accuracy and speed.
* Voter ballots pass through ABBYY's platform and into multiple stages, operating based on built in business rules that verify ballot selections and coordinate with the Quality Assurance team.
* The ABBYY solution's ability to operate according to applied business rules, such as accurately processing ballot selections, is a gamechanger for a highly time consuming, data sensitive, and outcome centric process.

#### Value

* 676,000 voting papers (color, A3 duplex) were processed within a three-week voting period.
* 94,000 voter applications, or approximately 400,000 papers, were processed in one day via ABBYY’s scalable architecture, passing through double veriﬁcation.
* ABBYY Content Intelligence transformed the entire process to be more agile and deliver fail-safe outcomes.
* Staff overtime is greatly reduced as a result of the speed, accuracy, and customization that makes it possible to dictate the process ﬂow needed, in terms of double veriﬁcation and voter ballot reconciliation.
* Electionz.com has the capacity to accommodate more volume and take on more clients while reducing the amount of time the team must spend processing papers, signiﬁcantly improving the bottom line and ROI.

 “The commitment and support we received from ABBYY was outstanding right from the PoC through delivering the ﬁnal election results to Councils.”

 – Steve Kilpatrick, Managing Director, Electionz.com
