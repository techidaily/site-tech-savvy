## 1\. Check OpenAI

 Even if [ChatGPT is the fastest-growing app](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-chatgpt-became-fastest-growing-app/) of all time, sometimes it stops working. The best way to check if ChatGPT is down is to use [OpenAI](https://status.openai.com/) for real-time server analysis, so you can easily figure out if ChatGPT is down for everyone else.

## 2\. Check if ChatGPT Is Available in Your Region

 Even if you can't access ChatGPT, there's a chance there's nothing wrong with it. If you travel to a region where ChatGPT isn't available, you'll get the "OpenAI services are not available in your country" message.

 The same goes if you're using a VPN and have set your virtual location to a country where ChatGPT isn't available. If you're unsure whether the AI tool is available in your country, you can check [ChatGPT's Supported Countries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).

## 3\. Check OpenAI Twitter

 When there's a problem with OpenAI servers, it's usually announced on the [OpenAI Twitter account](https://twitter.com/OpenAI). So, it's wise to follow their account and check it if you suspect ChatGPT has stopped working.

 Also, they put out an announcement once they fix the problem, so you should turn on Twitter notifications on your phone.

## 4\. Check on a Different Platform

 If you couldn't find any helpful information about why ChatGPT isn't working on its website or Twitter account, you should try a third-party platform. Using [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/status/openai/), you can find out if ChatGPT stopped working for other users or if it's a problem limited to your device.
