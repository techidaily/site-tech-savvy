## ChatGPT: The Mobile User's Ultimate Manual

 Most of you have likely already used ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that has taken the internet by storm. While various AI chatbot competitors quickly popped up, OpenAI's ChatGPT remains the most successful and sophisticated.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 For a long while after ChatGPT's launch, it was only accessible through its web app. If you wanted to access ChatGPT on your smartphone, it would also be through a browser. But there are other ways to access ChatGPT on your smartphone, starting with the official ChatGPT App for iOS.

## Using OpenAI's Official ChatGPT App

 ChatGPT is available for iOS and Android. Here's how you can use it:

1. Download and install the official [ChatGPT](https://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069) app.  
   * **Download:** ChatGPT for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2024179/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&hl=en&gl=US) | [iOS](http://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069) (Free)
2. Once it's installed, open and log in with your OpenAI account.
3. Tap **Continue** on the **Welcome** page.

Close

 Now you can start using ChatGPT as you would on your computer. If you cannot download the app because it's unavailable in your area, you can try using ChatGPT through the web browser method or download the third-party apps listed below.

## Using ChatGPT Through a Smartphone Web Browser

 On both Android and iOS devices, you can use your phone's web browser to access ChatGPT (if you'd prefer to avoid using the official ChatGPT apps). You need to create an account, launch the website through your smartphone web browser, and you're good to go.

1. Open any web browser and visit [chat.openai.com](http://chat.openai.com), the official ChatGPT website.
2. Login using your credentials (or sign up if you aren't yet registered).
3. Once you're done signing up/logging in, you'll be greeted by a few disclaimers. Tap **Next** for all of these, and then tap **Done** to start using ChatGPT.

 Like the desktop version, you can access previous conversations, [upgrade to ChatGPT Plus](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-plus-subscription-worth-it/), or even enable dark mode. You can access these settings by tapping the **menu icon** in the top-left corner of your screen.

## Using ChatGPT Through Siri Shortcuts

 Siri is a great virtual assistant but can't hold a candle to ChatGPT. However, if you ever wanted Siri to be more capable, you can combine ChatGPT with Siri. This method involves Siri Shortcuts, API keys for ChatGPT, and a little patience. Make sure you already have an OpenAI account before you proceed.

 Please note that this method requires you to add a payment method to your OpenAI account, which will then be charged based on how much you use ChatGPT. To understand this better, check out [ChatGPT API pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) and be sure that you know [how API tokens work](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/).

1. Open the [SiriGPT shortcut page](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/18cd4aad0abe4b4ebcc03ef3b4d0dc40), and your iPhone will ask you to open the file in the Shortcuts app. From here, tap **Add Shortcut**.
2. Get your OpenAI API keys by visiting [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Then, log into your OpenAI account, and tap the **menu icon** (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner of your screen.
3. Tap your profile icon at the bottom of the menu, then tap **View API keys**.
4. Next, tap **Create new secret key** and tap the **copy icon** to copy it to your clipboard. Tap **OK** to close the window.
5. You must add this API key to the SiriGPT shortcut we installed earlier. Open the Shortcuts app, find the SiriGPT short, and tap the **three dots** to edit the shortcut.
6. Paste your API key in place of the **Add API Key Here** placeholder text.
7. Go back to the Shortcuts menu and tap the SiriGPT shortcut. It will ask your permission to enable Speech Recognition for the shortcut. Tap **Allow**.
8. Run the shortcut again and ask it a question. Another pop-up will appear asking you to allow the shortcut to send text to the OpenAI API. Tap **Always Allow**.
9. Finally, you'll now get an answer in the voice of Siri. Tap **Done** or **Ask Again** if you want to give it another prompt.

 That's certainly a lot of work, and whether it's worth it depends on how much you use the shortcut. At its worst, it's a neat party trick, but at its best, you have the power of GPT in your hands, now with the voice of Siri powering it. Again, this is not the most convenient way of accessing ChatGPT, but it's surprising how well it works when it does.

## Third-Party ChatGPT Apps for Android and iOS

 If the official ChatGPT app is unavailable in your area, third-party apps are a great alternative. They provide a much more stable UI than the web version but don't just go with any third-party app with "chat" and "GPT" in its title. Most apps are garbage and want to steal your information—or worse.

 If you have an iPhone, you should give [Perplexity](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perplexity-ask-anything/id1668000334) a try. The app uses an AI-powered search engine and replicates a lot of the functionality of ChatGPT—one reason being that it's based on OpenAI's GPT technology. However, its purpose is slightly different because it is a search engine that fulfills text generation requests well. Perplexity can also provide sources for its answers, search the internet for real-time information, and even allows you to search by voice.

**Download:** Perplexity for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perplexity-ask-anything/id1668000334) (Free)

 If you have an Android, go with [Nova](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2024179/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scaleup.chatai&hl=en&gl=US). This third-party app, like Perplexity, is also based on the GPT technology from OpenAI, so you'll get similar results. While it lacks some of Perplexity's functionality, it features multi-language support, chat history, and the ability to share your chats directly from the app.

## Protect Yourself From Scams

 Amid all the excitement with AI, staying on your toes is important. You can easily fall victim to apps that steal your data, charge you for no reason, or annoy you with a constant barrage of ads.

 Your best bet is to go with the official app or use the web version in the absence of it. But, then, the Siri Shortcuts method is great, too. Furthermore, if you need a third-party ChatGPT app, stick with our recommendations. However, if you want the best experience, stick to the official ChatGPT website or the official ChatGPT app, or try Microsoft's Bing AI Chat.

## The Power of AI in the Palm of Your Hands

 As AI grows exponentially, it's good to see that you can easily take advantage of it straight from your phone. Whether you use the official ChatGPT app, the web browser version, or a third-party app, you should be able to get the most out of these chatbots without much issue. Just remember that these AI chatbots can be confidently wrong a lot of times. As such, it is always important to do your research. While AI is a great tool, blindly trusting it is not the best idea.
