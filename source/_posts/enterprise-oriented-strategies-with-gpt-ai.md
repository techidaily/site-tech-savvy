## What Is ChatGPT Enterprise, and What Are Its Capabilities?

 ChatGPT Enterprise represents a major upgrade from the regular ChatGPT model that has captured the world's interest.

 While the standard ChatGPT offers a glimpse into the transformative potential of [large language models](http://makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/), ChatGPT Enterprise enhances this with enterprise-specific features tailored for business use cases.

### Uncapped Access to GPT-4

 One of the biggest limitations of regular ChatGPT is the usage caps in place to manage overwhelming demand (between 25 and 200 messages per three hours). ChatGPT Enterprise removes these restraints, providing unlimited conversational queries with its upgraded GPT-4 model. This allows your team to fully utilize ChatGPT's capabilities without worrying about running into limits.

 The enterprise version also delivers up to two times faster response times compared to the regular versions, enabling more dynamic back-and-forth conversations. Long input delays are eliminated, and you get answers rapidly.

### Increased Context for Complex Questions

 ChatGPT Enterprise expands the context window to 32,000 tokens, four times more than the regular GPT-4 model (with 8192 tokens). This enables processing significantly longer and more detailed inputs.

 You can pose multifaceted questions, input large passages of text, or provide broader background information to guide ChatGPT's responses. The expanded context results in more accurate and nuanced answers for complex business needs.

### Advanced-Data Analysis

 Beyond text, ChatGPT Enterprise offers unlimited access to advanced statistical analysis abilities. This feature, [known as Code Interpreter](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-code-interpreter/) to regular ChatGPT users, lets both technical and non-technical users extract key insights from data sets and tables in seconds.

 So, whether you need to analyze financial models, parse survey results, or work with structured data, ChatGPT Enterprise can crunch the numbers and deliver the highlights you need.

### Customizability for Organizational Needs

 The average-user ChatGPT delivers one-size-fits-all functionality. But ChatGPT Enterprise allows tailoring to your business through features like shared templates, workflow collaboration, and integration with company systems.

 You can build libraries of templates for common queries, ensuring organizational consistency. ChatGPT Enterprise also provides credits to [access and use OpenAI APIs](https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-api-guide-what-can-you-do/), enabling advanced customization by your developer team.

 The end result is an AI assistant tuned to your specific needs, with expansive knowledge of your business processes and data.

### Enterprise-Grade Security and Privacy

 Many businesses have reasonable [concerns about conversational AI's security and privacy implications](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-privacy-issues/). ChatGPT Enterprise is designed to enterprise standards, with multiple protections:

* Your data is never used to train OpenAI models or retained. Conversations stay private.
* Encryption safeguards data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES 256).
* Compliance with SOC 2 (Service Organization Control Type 2) standards.
* Tools like Single Sign-On (SSO), usage analytics, domain verification, and user management provide deployment control.

 With ChatGPT Enterprise, you get state-of-the-art AI capabilities with peace of mind that your business information stays protected.

## ChatGPT Enterprise Availability and Pricing

 ChatGPT Enterprise is now available for businesses looking to leverage the power of AI. While OpenAI has not publicly disclosed pricing, they offer custom quotes based on each company's unique needs and use cases.

 Factors impacting pricing include the number of users, query volume, and any custom integrations or features required.

 So, if you are interested in ChatGPT Enterprise, you will need to [contact OpenAI sales](https://openai.com/contact-sales) to request a quote.
