## 1 ChatGPT

![ChatGPT dashboard responding to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chatgpt-ai-search-engine-1.jpeg)

 It's only fitting to begin this list with the AI chatbot that spearheaded the widespread adoption of AI-powered conversational search engines. OpenAI's ChatGPT has garnered immense popularity since its launch thanks to its ability to process queries and provide human-sounding responses.

 The [ChatGPT Plus $20/month premium subscription offers several benefits](http://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-you-should-upgrade-chatgpt-plus/), including internet access and search. It gives you access to more relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information, among other features like GPT-4, custom GPTs, DALL-E 3 image generation, and priority access to new features.

## 2 Microsoft Copilot

![The Copilot dashboard in Edge showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-copilot.jpeg)

 In February 2023, Microsoft introduced Bing AI, a cutting-edge AI search engine powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 AI model, to enhance its search experience. Later in 2023, [Microsoft rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-rebrand-bing-chat-copilot-compete-chatgpt/), opening up its innovative AI technology to other systems beyond Bing.

 Copilot's search experience is similar to its predecessor, Bing AI Chat. It responds in a conversational format with reference sources you can explore for more information. You can ask follow-up questions to refine your search and get more personalized results. Beyond search, you can use Copilot to write essays, emails, or lines of code, generate images, shop, and more.

 However, what sets this AI companion apart is its accessibility across various platforms and devices, including Copilot for Android and iOS, Copilot in Microsoft Edge, and Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps.

## 3 Gemini

![The Gemini dashboard showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-gemini.jpeg)

 Formerly known as Bard, Gemini is Google's AI chatbot and generative search tool. Both Bard and Gemini's initial releases have been marred with controversies. Bard made factual errors in its first demo, and while the rebranded and reborn Gemini has shown significant improvements and reliability, its image creation feature has been accused of racial bias and other issues.

 However, those issues aside, you can use Gemini's extensions to access information from Google Workspace, YouTube, Google Maps, and more. For instance, you can use the **@Gmail** command to search for specific emails in your inbox or **@Google Drive** to access specific files in your account. This gives you a more personalized search experience. Moreover, you can also [use Gemini instead of Google Assistant on your Android device](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-google-gemini-on-android/).

 If you are looking for one of the best [generative AI tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/generative-ai-tools-improve-work-life/) with real-time, accurate, and cited information to assist with your research task, Perplaxity AI is a great choice. Perplexity.ai is an AI-powered conversational answer engine that provides concise and well-cited responses based on your queries, eliminating the need to skip from one link to another to find relevant information on a traditional search engine.

 Unlike other AI chatbots that often generate inaccurate responses, using Perplexity.ai is one of the best ways to [minimize AI hallucination](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reduce-ai-hallucination/) (the tendency of AI models to make up information), making it a reliable AI search tool for research. In addition, you can toggle its **Pro Search** feature to get more comprehensive and fine-tuned responses based on your preferences, but the free version is limited to five searches per day.

![You.com dashboard showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-you-com.jpeg)

 You.com is a great pick if you are looking for a customizable yet privacy-focused AI-powered search engine. Its privacy-focused approach helps you avoid being bombarded with custom ads. At the same time, its ability to continuously learn from your search history enables it to provide more personalized search results over time.

 You.com provides several search modes, including **Smart** for quick and concise responses with sources, **Genius** for in-depth explanations and detailed responses, and **Research** for comprehensive responses with extensive source citations. Lastly, you can also use You.com to generate images and write essays, emails, blogs, and more.

 Although traditional search engines do a decent job of providing information based on your queries, it can sometimes be frustrating and time-consuming to sift through numerous links to find the information you need. With AI-powered search engines like those we have mentioned, you can improve your browsing experience by enjoying more personalized responses in a conversational format.

![The Copilot dashboard in Edge showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-copilot.jpeg)

 In February 2023, Microsoft introduced Bing AI, a cutting-edge AI search engine powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 AI model, to enhance its search experience. Later in 2023, [Microsoft rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-rebrand-bing-chat-copilot-compete-chatgpt/), opening up its innovative AI technology to other systems beyond Bing.

 Copilot's search experience is similar to its predecessor, Bing AI Chat. It responds in a conversational format with reference sources you can explore for more information. You can ask follow-up questions to refine your search and get more personalized results. Beyond search, you can use Copilot to write essays, emails, or lines of code, generate images, shop, and more.

 However, what sets this AI companion apart is its accessibility across various platforms and devices, including Copilot for Android and iOS, Copilot in Microsoft Edge, and Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps.

![The Gemini dashboard showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-gemini.jpeg)

 Formerly known as Bard, Gemini is Google's AI chatbot and generative search tool. Both Bard and Gemini's initial releases have been marred with controversies. Bard made factual errors in its first demo, and while the rebranded and reborn Gemini has shown significant improvements and reliability, its image creation feature has been accused of racial bias and other issues.

 However, those issues aside, you can use Gemini's extensions to access information from Google Workspace, YouTube, Google Maps, and more. For instance, you can use the **@Gmail** command to search for specific emails in your inbox or **@Google Drive** to access specific files in your account. This gives you a more personalized search experience. Moreover, you can also [use Gemini instead of Google Assistant on your Android device](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-google-gemini-on-android/).

![Perplexity dashboard showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-perplexity.jpeg)

 If you are looking for one of the best [generative AI tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/generative-ai-tools-improve-work-life/) with real-time, accurate, and cited information to assist with your research task, Perplaxity AI is a great choice. Perplexity.ai is an AI-powered conversational answer engine that provides concise and well-cited responses based on your queries, eliminating the need to skip from one link to another to find relevant information on a traditional search engine.

 Unlike other AI chatbots that often generate inaccurate responses, using Perplexity.ai is one of the best ways to [minimize AI hallucination](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reduce-ai-hallucination/) (the tendency of AI models to make up information), making it a reliable AI search tool for research. In addition, you can toggle its **Pro Search** feature to get more comprehensive and fine-tuned responses based on your preferences, but the free version is limited to five searches per day.

## 5 You.com

![You.com dashboard showing a response to a query](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ai-search-engine-you-com.jpeg)

 You.com is a great pick if you are looking for a customizable yet privacy-focused AI-powered search engine. Its privacy-focused approach helps you avoid being bombarded with custom ads. At the same time, its ability to continuously learn from your search history enables it to provide more personalized search results over time.

 You.com provides several search modes, including **Smart** for quick and concise responses with sources, **Genius** for in-depth explanations and detailed responses, and **Research** for comprehensive responses with extensive source citations. Lastly, you can also use You.com to generate images and write essays, emails, blogs, and more.

 Although traditional search engines do a decent job of providing information based on your queries, it can sometimes be frustrating and time-consuming to sift through numerous links to find the information you need. With AI-powered search engines like those we have mentioned, you can improve your browsing experience by enjoying more personalized responses in a conversational format.

 Traditional search engines help you find relevant information by providing links to web pages, but the integration of AI chatbots has revolutionized this process. AI-powered search engines and tools use natural language processing and other advanced algorithms to understand search intent and context and deliver more relevant, personalized, and human-like conversational responses.
