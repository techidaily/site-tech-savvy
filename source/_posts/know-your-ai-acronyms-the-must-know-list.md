## 16\. Hyperparameters

 Hyperparameters are settings that define how an algorithm or a machine learning model learns and behaves. Hyperparameters include learning rate, regularization strength, and the number of hidden layers in the network. You can tinker with these parameters to fine-tune the model's performance according to your needs.

## 17\. Large Language Model (LLM)

 An LLM is a machine learning model trained on vast amounts of data and uses supervised learning to produce the next token in a given context to produce meaningful, contextual responses to user inputs.

## 27\. Tokenization

 Tokenization is the process of splitting a text document into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can represent words, numbers, phrases, symbols, or any elements in text that a program can work with. The purpose of tokenization is to make the most sense out of unstructured data without processing the entire text as a single string, which is computationally inefficient and difficult to model.

## 28\. Turing Test

 Introduced by Alan Turing in 1950, this test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligence indistinguishable from that of a human. The [Turing test](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-turing-test-ever-beaten/) involves a human judge interacting with a human and a machine without knowing which is which.

## Embracing the Language of Artificial Intelligence

 AI is a rapidly evolving field changing how we interact with technology. However, with so many new buzzwords constantly emerging, it can be hard to keep up with the latest developments in the field.

## 26\. Supervised Learning

 A machine learning method where the model is trained using labeled data with the desired output. The model generalizes from the labeled data and makes accurate predictions on new data.

## 27\. Tokenization

 Tokenization is the process of splitting a text document into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can represent words, numbers, phrases, symbols, or any elements in text that a program can work with. The purpose of tokenization is to make the most sense out of unstructured data without processing the entire text as a single string, which is computationally inefficient and difficult to model.

## 28\. Turing Test

 Introduced by Alan Turing in 1950, this test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligence indistinguishable from that of a human. The [Turing test](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-turing-test-ever-beaten/) involves a human judge interacting with a human and a machine without knowing which is which. If the judge fails to distinguish the machine from the human, the machine is considered to have passed the test.

## 29\. Unsupervised Learning

 A machine learning method where the model makes inferences from unlabeled datasets. It discovers patterns in the data to make predictions on unseen data.
