## Debating Top Talkers: GPT vs HuggingChat's Clash

 When ChatGPT burst spectacularly onto the scene, it was inevitable that similar tools would soon follow. One of these is HuggingChat. At first glance, HuggingChat and ChatGPT look and behave very similarly. Both tools perform similar functions, have similar interfaces, and use AI to produce responses.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 However, dig a little deeper, and notable differences become quickly apparent.

## What Is HuggingChat?

 We won't go into too much detail here, as by now, most people know [what generative AI chatbots are](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/). But it is worth touching on, as this will help you understand some underlying differences between the two chatbots.

 Put simply, HuggingChat is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT. [Open-source means that the code is freely available](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-open-source/) to the public. This gives the platform customization options that platforms like ChatGPT lack.

 Broadly speaking, HuggingChat can perform the same functions as its closed-source cousin, ChatGPT:

* **Writing assistance**: Writing tips, ideas, grammar corrections, email, and article composition.
* **Technical Support**: An embedded technical knowledge base allows the tool to be used as a technical assistant.
* **Natural Language Search**: HuggingChat allows you to search the internet without relying on keyword queries.

 Now that we know all about HuggingChat, let's see how it stacks up against ChatGPT.

## HuggingChat vs. ChatGPT: How Do They Compare?

 Let's start by comparing how to access the tools. ChatGPT first, although it is possible to [use ChatGPT without an account](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-use-chatgpt-without-openai-account/), accessing the tool directly will require an [OpenAI account](https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup/identifier?state=hKFo2SBJYnBoZTVIMkdqWVZDVmgxRjVVYXhhc2tnaDhmN1U4VaFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIDd3aGZkd2QxOG91WmJFV3BBdEN3TXhWVF9UdWRwOEUzo2NpZNkgVGRKSWNiZTE2V29USHROOTVueXl3aDVFNHlPbzZJdEc). Once you have set this up, the tool is free to use (unless you [upgrade to ChatGPT Pro](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt4/)).

 Now, with HuggingChat, the waters are a bit murkier. If asked, HuggingChat will assure you that an account is required, as the image below confirms.

![Screenshot of HuggingChat confirming an account is required](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-huggingchat-confirming-an-account-is-required.jpg)

 However, we used it with an account and without any problems. If this changes, or you'd prefer to set up an account, it is free, and you can sign up on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/join).

 The tools have remarkably similar interfaces, as the bulk of these tools do. Simplicity is the key to AI chatbots, and both tools have a simple input box to allow you to enter prompts, which is about it. However, learning [prompting techniques can help improve response quality](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/).

 Next, we will look at other metrics and capabilities and compare the responses.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

 The beating heart of any AI chatbot is the LLM. These are the underlying datasets used to generate human-like responses to prompts. Each tool uses a different LLM, as described below.

* **ChatGPT**: ChatGPT is based on OpenAI's GPT family of LLMs. More specifically, the free version of the tool uses GPT-3.5, and Premium users have access to GPT-4\. ChatGPT is restricted to using data collected up to late 2021 only.
* **HuggingChat:**  HuggingChat is based on Meta's LlaMA LLM. This has the advantage of access to data collected up to April 12, 2023\.

 This should give HuggingChat an advantage when searching for current data. We tested this by asking both tools the same question: Who won the Baseball World Series in 2022?

 As you can see, HuggingChat answered this easily.

 Whereas, ChatGPT appears to believe that 2022 lies in the future!

## Summarizing Articles

 You can use URLs to "force" both tools to access more current data. We tested this ability by asking them to summarize a MakeUseOf article on [remotely accessing Android phones](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/can-i-control-a-phone-with-my-computer-android/). In the first instance, we provided the URL.

 Both tools managed this with the ChatGPT response edging it in quality as it summarized the tools mentioned in the article.

![Screenshot of ChatGPt summary with URL of article](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-chatgpt-summary-with-url-of-article.jpg)

 The HuggingChat response wasn't bad but lacked some of the detail covered by ChatGPT.

![Screenshot of HuggingChat summarzing MUO article-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-huggingchat-summarzing-muo-article-1.jpg)

 To test this ability further, we asked a similar question without entering the URL and using an article that was only published (it was "[What Are IPFS Phishing Attacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-ipfs-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-avoid-them)," for reference). Again, both tools managed this admirably, as the images demonstrate.

 This was ChatGPT's effort:

![Screenshot of ChatGPT referencing an article without a URL](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-chatgpt-referencing-an-article-without-a-url.jpg)

 HuggingChat's summary looked like this:

![Screenshot of HuggingChat summarizing article without a URL](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-huggingchat-summarizing-article-without-a-url.jpg)

 There isn't much difference between the two tools here, so let's see how they compare when we test them for creativity.

## HuggingChat vs. ChatGPT: How Do They Compare Creatively?

 Although surrounded by controversy, the ability to create creative works is perhaps one of the most useful aspects of AI chatbots. However, we will sidestep the moral and ethical implications and put the tools head-to-head in a creative clash of the chatbots.

 Creativity is a difficult metric to quantify. What is poetry to your ears may be unintelligible nonsense to the next person. So, all we will do here is set an identical task for both tools and let you decide which reply buzzed your buttons.

 We asked both to compose a two-verse love song based on Romeo and Juliet. This was ChatGPT's response:

![Screenshot of ChatGPT lovesong](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-chatgpt-lovesong.jpg)

 And this was HuggingChat's.

![Screenshot HuggingChat love song](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-huggingchat-love-song.jpg)

 Shakespeare himself would be impressed with both of these!

## Security and Privacy

 Security and privacy are general concerns surrounding generative AI. There are [definite security concerns with ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/does-chatgpt-have-security-risks-or-issues/), but it is fair to say that most of these concerns apply to most chatbots, including HuggingChat.

 The problem is that this fledgling technology has plenty of rough edges. Security is certainly one of these. These tools are incredibly powerful, but care is needed as security and privacy issues include:

* **Data privacy**: The training data contains personal information and have access to user data.
* **Malicious use**: Bad actors can use it to generate spam and fake news, and it can also be used to aid in phishing attacks.
* **Cybersecurity vulnerabilities**: ChatGPT is a complex system that may contain cybersecurity vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

 One thing to note is that HuggingChat seems to work fine with an account. This is useful if you want to minimize the privacy risks associated with the platforms.

## Which Is Best: HuggingChat or ChatGPT?

 As you can see from the tests, there is no easy answer. ChatGPT had a definite edge when summarizing articles, whereas HuggingChat had the advantage when you compare how current the training data is.

 One of the big problems when trying to decide between the tools is that the results of any given prompt are unpredictable. In essence, this means that if you tweak a prompt slightly, the quality and accuracy of the results can vary wildly.

 On the point of accuracy, both these tools acknowledge that the accuracy of the results may be flawed. You should always take this into account when using either of them.

 We also found both tools to be responsive and quick with answers. This would seem to illustrate that ChatGPT has addressed the demand issues that slowed the platform down.

 Ultimately, the choice between them will likely be driven more by user requirements than user preferences. As the tools are free and quick to access, checking both out is not a great hassle.

## Are You a Hugger or a Chatter?

 These tools represent the future of human and machine interaction. Both are incredibly powerful, and it wasn't so long ago that the thought of having such tools at your fingertips would have seemed inconceivable.

 As AI tools continue to advance, the choice between HuggingChat and ChatGPT will ultimately depend on the user's specific needs. However, the unpredictable nature of their results highlights the importance of careful consideration and evaluation of each tool's strengths and weaknesses.

 What these show us is that AI has reached a point of critical momentum. Tools such as HuggingChat and ChatGPT will continue to develop and improve, and no doubt, many others will follow.
