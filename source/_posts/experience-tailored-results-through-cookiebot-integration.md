i.

iii. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN ABBYY AND YOU. ABBYY'S PRICING REFLECTS THIS ALLOCATION OF RISKS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREES THAT THIS LIMIT ON LIABILITY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT ABBYY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITS.

b. If You entered into this Agreement with ABBYY Europe GmbH, the following rules shall apply to You instead of section 11.1(a) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

i. ABBYY’s statutory liability for damages shall be limited as follows: (1) ABBYY shall be liable only up to the amount of damages as typically foreseeable at the time of entering into the purchase agreement in respect of damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation required for the appropriate execution of the agreement and (2) ABBYY shall not be liable for damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a non-material contractual obligation. ABBYY shall not bear any liability beyond the limits set above in this section 11, especially not in cases of consequential damages, loss of revenue or profits, punitive damages or any other special damages.

ii. The above limitation of liability also applies in respect of the personal liability of the employees, representatives and agents of ABBYY.

iii. The limitation of liability set forth above shall not restrict any mandatory statutory liability, in particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act, liability for assuming a specific guarantee, liability for damage arising from a grossly negligent breach of duty or liability for culpably caused injuries to life, body or health.

11.2\. **Defense and Indemnification by You.**

a. Defense of Claims. You shall defend ABBYY and its Affiliates and Representatives, and each of its and their respective Representatives, officers, directors, employees, successors, and assignees (each, an “**ABBYY Indemnitee**”) against any allegation, suit or claim that directly or indirectly arises out of or relates to any of the following (individually, a “**Claim**”, and collectively, the “**Claims**”):

i. Any information that You provide to ABBYY, including any Processing of Uploaded Data by or on behalf of ABBYY in accordance with this Agreement;

ii. Any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content, or technology) provided by or on Your behalf or any Authorized User, including ABBYY’s compliance with any specifications or directions provided by or on behalf of You or any Authorized User to the extent prepared without any contribution by ABBYY;

iii. Your breach of any of Your representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under this Agreement; or

iv. Any act or omission by You, any Authorized User / End User, Your Representatives, or any third party on Your behalf, including any negligent acts or omissions, wilful misconduct, or strict liability thereof, including, but not limited to acts or omissions that infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third party’s Intellectual Property rights.

b. Indemnification by You. You shall indemnify and hold harmless each ABBYY Indemnitee against any damages, liabilities, assessments, losses, costs, and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses) incurred by that ABBYY Indemnitee relating to any Claim, including:

i. All damages, liabilities, assessments, losses, costs, and other expenses (including reasonable attorney fees and legal expenses) finally awarded against an ABBYY Indemnitee in any proceeding relating to any Claim;

ii. All out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by an ABBYY Indemnitee in connection with the defense of any Claim (other than attorneys’ fees and costs incurred without Your consent after You has accepted defense of such Claim); and

iii. If any Claim is settled between You and the third party, all amounts agreed to by You as part of such settlement.

c. Process. ABBYY shall give You reasonable notice of each Claim for which it seeks indemnity, except that failure to provide such notice will not release You from any obligations hereunder except to the extent that You are materially prejudiced by such failure. ABBYY will also give You its reasonable cooperation in the defense of each Claim, at Your expense. You may not use any counsel that would have a conflict of interest in representing ABBYY’s interests to defend any Claim. An ABBYY Indemnitee may participate in the defense of a Claim at its own expense. You will not settle any Claim without the relevant ABBYY Indemnitees’ prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. You shall ensure that any settlement You make of any Claim is made confidential, except where not permitted by Applicable Law. Your duty to defend is independent of Your duty to indemnify.

11.3\. **Indemnification by ABBYY.**

a. Defense. Subject to section 11.1, ABBYY shall defend You and Your Affiliates and Representatives, and each of its and their respective Representatives, officers, directors, successors, and assignees (each “**Your Indemnitee**”) against any allegation or claim that Service when used in accordance with the terms in this Agreement, violates the Intellectual Property Rights of a third party in the United States.

b. Indemnification. If any portion of the Service is, or in ABBYY’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, then ABBYY, at its sole option and expense, will either: (A) obtain for You the necessary rights to continue using the Service; (B) replace the Service with products that are substantially equivalent in function, or modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function; or (C) refund You the portion of the Subscription Fees paid to ABBYY for the portion of the Subscription Term during which You may no longer use the Service. THE FOREGOING SETS FORTH ABBYY’S EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS STATED IN THIS SECTION 11.3 HEREIN.

c. Process. You shall give ABBYY reasonable notice of each claim for which it seeks indemnity, except that failure to provide such notice will not release ABBYY from any obligations hereunder except to the extent that ABBYY is materially prejudiced by such failure. You will also give ABBYY its reasonable cooperation in the defense of each claim, at ABBYY’s expense. ABBYY may not use any counsel that would have a conflict of interest in representing Your interests to defend any claim. Your Indemnitee may participate in the defense of a Claim at its own expense. ABBYY will not settle any Claim without the relevant Your Indemnitees’ prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. ABBYY shall ensure that any settlement ABBYY makes of any Claim is made confidential, except where not permitted by Applicable Law. ABBYY’s duty to defend is independent of ABBYY’s duty to indemnify.

11.4\. **Dispute with Third Parties.** All disputes between You and third parties, whether relating to any information, data or forms available on or through the Service, will be settled by and between You and such third party. ABBYY bears no responsibility for resolving such disputes and has no obligation to be involved in any way in any such dispute.

##### 12\. Miscellaneous Provisions

12.1\. **Assignment.** ABBYY may assign and transfer its rights and obligations hereunder (or any part thereof) to a third party at any time without Your consent. ABBYY will endeavor to give You notice of such assignment or transfer. You may not assign or transfer any of the rights or responsibilities set forth herein without the express written consent of ABBYY, and any purported attempt to do so is hereby deemed null and void.
