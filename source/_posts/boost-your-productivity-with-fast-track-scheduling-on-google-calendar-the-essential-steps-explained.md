Are you constantly going from one meeting to another with little to no downtime in between? If that sounds like you, and [you use Google Calendar](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-share-a-google-calendar-with-friends-family-or-colleagues-for-easy-collaboration/) to manage your daily grind, you might be interested in a feature called Speedy meetings. 

### More how-tos

Essentially, Speedy meetings add a short buffer between those back-to-back meetings. 

Once you've enabled Speedy meetings, the actual scheduled meeting is slightly shorter than the intended duration. 

This feature works for meetings that are 30 minutes or longer and will give you the downtime you need to catch your breath or gather your thoughts between those meetings.

Once you've enabled Speedy meetings, all meetings of 30 minutes or more will be shortened by 5 or 10 minutes. So 30-minute meetings will be scheduled for 25 minutes, 45-minute meetings will be shortened to 40 minutes, and 60-minute meetings will be shortened to 50 minutes.

Anyone that has a full daily calendar of meetings will greatly appreciate that 5 to 10 minutes of downtime. Have a bathroom break, get a cup of coffee, or just take a breather.

Okay, before I show you how to set up this feature, I fully understand that what's on your calendar and what happens, in reality, can often be two very different things. You might have a Speedy meeting that's only 25 minutes, but it's up to you and the participants to stick to that time frame. If you go over, there's nothing Google Calendar or Speedy meetings can do. However, once you start using Speedy meetings, you just have to be diligent about sticking to the calendar such that a 25-minute meeting is just that.

On top of that, if other people have access to your calendar or if you sent out invites or updates about those meetings, your attendees will be apprised as to the length of the meeting. That means you are better able to end the meeting at the scheduled time.

At this point, whenever you create a meeting that's 30 minutes or more, it will always be just a bit shorter, so you can enjoy a breather between meetings. This is a great option for anyone that suffers from days of back-to-back meetings. The temptation might be to slam through them without the slightest break, but you know what that does to you by the end of the day or week.
