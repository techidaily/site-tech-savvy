## Digital Coaching: Engaging AI in Psychological Support

 The year is 2023\. Cars can drive themselves, fridges can tell you when you're out of milk, and AI is moonlighting as people's therapists. What a time to be alive! It's possible to use ChatGPT, OpenAI's large language model, as a digital mental health coach—with some caveats.

 Now, before you start envisioning a robot shrink in a comfy leather armchair saying, "Tell me about your relationship with your mother," let's make something clear: ChatGPT is not a licensed therapist. But it can be a handy tool to help manage your mental well-being.

## Designing Your Coach or Mental Health Professional

 Three are many [apps that contain chatbots acting as pocket therapists](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-chatbot-therapist-mobile-apps-pocket/). However, there's no denying ChatGPT's level of sophistication. Just look at its meteoric adoption rate.

 No, it doesn't have a framed degree hanging on its wall or years of expensive training from an Ivy League university. However, it can mimic therapeutic techniques based on your prompts. And even though it's not a real person, [ChatGPT can provide reliable health information](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-provide-reliable-health-information/), if you know how to use it correctly.

### The Art of Prompting for Mental Health Information

 Prompts are the questions or statements you feed to ChatGPT to guide its responses. They're like the steering wheel of your conversation—the more precise your directions, the more accurate your destination.

 If you want ChatGPT to mimic a specific philosophy or therapeutic approach, your prompts need to be crafted accordingly. For instance, if you want some Stoic wisdom, you might ask, "What would a Stoic philosopher say about handling stress?"

 Or if you prefer a Buddhist lens, you could try "How would a Buddhist advise me to handle burnout?" For a more modern psychology approach, you could use a prompt like, "Give me cognitive behavioral strategies for managing anxiety."

 Alternatively, to mimic a trauma-informed counseling session, you might describe your situation followed by a question such as, "How can I approach managing stress with a trauma-informed perspective?"

 Here's the best part: you're not limited to one persona. You can switch between a Stoic philosopher, a Zen master, or a modern psychologist, depending on your mood. It's like having a team of therapists at your fingertips, minus the outrageous costs.

 Remember though, your AI pal is not psychic. It won't remember past conversations or know your personal history unless you tell it. So, the more details you can provide ahead of your question, the more tailored ChatGPT's response will be. Don't shy away from providing some context with your prompts.

## Advanced Chat GPT Training

 Let's explore how to train ChatGPT to dig a bit deeper, ask those probing questions, and tailor its advice to your specific situation. The key here is to understand that ChatGPT can respond to complex, multi-layered prompts.

 For example, let's say you're dealing with stress at work. Instead of simply asking, "How can I manage stress?" you could use a more detailed prompt like, "I'm feeling stressed at work because of tight deadlines and a difficult boss. How can a Stoic philosopher advise me to handle this situation?"

![Screenshot of ChatGPT giving Stoic advice](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-2023-05-13-at-11-06-50-am.jpg)

 By providing this additional context, you're helping ChatGPT generate more specific, tailored advice. Or, let's say you're struggling with a personal relationship. You could ask, "I had an argument with my friend because of a misunderstanding, and it's causing me a lot of distress. What would a therapist suggest I do to resolve this situation?"

 By layering your prompts in this way, you're training ChatGPT to provide more specific, relevant advice. You can also supercharge your prompt by adding something like, "Ask any follow-up questions to understand the situation better before providing a response". This will result in a response that more closely approximates a conversation with a mental health coach.

## Setting Healthy Boundaries With Your AI

 Imagine having a therapist or philosophical advisor who's always there, ready to chat 24/7\. Can't sleep because of a problem you're having with someone at work? Well, you can access ChatGPT anytime.

 Sound amazing? Not so fast. Without self-imposed boundaries, you might find your newfound best buddy becoming a hindrance rather than a helpful tool. Just because ChatGPT is always ready for a chat doesn't mean you should be.

 Consider using it during specific "sessions" only. Maybe it's 20 minutes in the morning with your coffee or a quick chat before bed. By setting a schedule, you'll avoid falling down the rabbit hole of endless AI conversations.

 Next, avoid sharing overly sensitive personal information. Remember, while ChatGPT doesn't store personal data, it's good practice to keep highly personal or sensitive topics offline. You never know where your words will end up.

 Also, make sure to balance your use of AI with friends and family and if necessary, other mental health resources. ChatGPT is a supplement, not a substitute. Keep up with your real-world people and never replace them with a chatbot.

### Know When to Seek Human Help

 While ChatGPT is a fantastic listener and can serve up some solid advice, it has its limits. It's like a Swiss Army Knife—versatile, but you wouldn't want to use it to chop down a tree. That's why it's crucial to know when to switch gears and seek help from a real human.

 For example, while [ChatGPT may replace some jobs](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-replace-me/), it isn't equipped to handle mental health emergencies. If you're experiencing a crisis, or having thoughts of self-harm, reach out to a professional immediately.

 Crisis hotlines, emergency services, and licensed therapists are all far better equipped to provide the help you need in such situations.

 Furthermore, if you're dealing with complex issues or deep-seated traumas, a trained human therapist will be able to provide a level of understanding, empathy, and care that ChatGPT can't. It's okay to need human help. It's okay to seek it, and it's okay to accept it. No algorithm can replace the nuanced understanding, the shared experiences, and the simple, comforting presence of another human being.

## Using ChatGPT as a Mental Health Coach

 By now you should understand how to use ChatGPT as a mental health coach, including how to craft prompts, create an AI persona, and train ChatGPT to provide tailored advice.

 But remember, ChatGPT is a tool, not a replacement for professional help. It's your pocket-sized companion for general advice, not a certified therapist. If you're dealing with serious issues, don't hesitate to seek human help. Happy chatting!
