## What Is ChatGPT Everywhere?

 ChatGPT Everywhere is one of many [amazing extensions for ChatGPT](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-chrome-extensions-better-ai-prompts-answers-in-browsers/). This plugin, in particular, provides direct access to ChatGPT on any website. Besides typical responses from ChatGPT, it also provides additional information when making searches on Google, and has specialized prompts for email responses.

 You can open the extension by clicking its icon in your browser's toolbar, or by using the **Ctrl + Space** hotkey. This opens a small window overlay for entering prompts.

 It works with any Chromium-based browser, including Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Vivaldi. It's quite similar in functionality, in fact, to the integrated [Bing AI chat in Microsoft Edge](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-edge-bing-ai-sidebar/).

## How to Use ChatGPT Everywhere

 Installing ChatGPT Everywhere on your browser is a similar process to [installing any ChatGPT plugin or extension](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/), you can visit the website or open it in the Chrome web store. After adding the extension to your browser, its icon should appear at the top or on the dropdown list after clicking the extension **puzzle piece icon**.

 Before getting started, you have to log in to your ChatGPT account. You can do so separately, or enter a prompt and hit **Ask** for a login request to appear. It's worth mentioning that the extension will send the queries to ChatGPT via API, and these will show up as conversations on your ChatGPT account.

 Once installed, bring up the overlay window by hitting **Ctrl + Space** on your keyboard, or tapping the extension's icon in your browser's toolbar. Here you can select **General** or **Email** in a dropdown menu. **General** is for common prompts that you would typically use with ChatGPT and will provide responses that you'd normally get on the ChatGPT website.

 The **Email** option can be especially usefulâ€“it can grab content from an email and auto-generate a reply. It's cordial, stays on topic, and answers every part of an incoming message. For both **General** and **Email** prompts, there are ways you can fine-tune the outputs if you're not satisfied with what's produced.

 To make changes, open the [ChatGPT site](https://chat.openai.com/chat), log in, and check your latest chat sessions. Here, you can see the modifications made by ChatGPT Everywhere when pinging the service. Here, all you have to do is make adjustments to the prompt that the extension generated and send it again.
