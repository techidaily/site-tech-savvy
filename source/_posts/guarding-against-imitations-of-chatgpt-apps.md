## Guarding Against Imitations of ChatGPT Apps

 Have you ever searched for ChatGPT on the Apple App Store and found multiple apps claiming to be the official ones? Unfortunately, most of them are rather dangerous for your iPhone.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm after its release, inviting cyber attackers to take advantage of its popularity. So, how do you spot a fake ChatGPT app on Apple App Store? Keep reading.

## Does ChatGPT Have an Official iOS App?

 If you wish to use ChatGPT on your iPhone, you may want to install the dedicated app from its official developersâ€”OpenAI. For iPhone users, OpenAI launched an official ChatGPT app that can be installed directly from the App Store. Any app other than the official one by OpenAI claiming to be the "official" ChatGPT app should be treated with caution.

 Cybercriminals always look for the easiest opportunity to target a large group of users in order to scam them, so currently, they are cashing in on ChatGPT's name. As a result, fake versions of the ChatGPT app have started appearing on the App Store to lure unsuspecting users into downloading them.

 Apart from the official app, there is another way to use ChatGPT on your iPhone. You can do that easily by navigating to the official website through [Safari or any other browser](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-use-safari-over-other-browsers-on-mac/) on your iOS device.

## How Can You Spot a Fake App on Apple App Store?

 You should always take some precautions when [downloading an app from the App Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-apps-from-app-store/) and check if it is a legitimate version of ChatGPT. Here are some ways to spot a fake ChatGPT app on the App Store.

### Check the Developer's Name

 The most reliable way to identify a fake app is by checking the name of its developer. As already mentioned, there is an official ChatGPT app released by OpenAI for iOS. So, if you find any other application claiming to be the official ChatGPT app but has a different developer's name, it is surely a fraudulent version.

 You can also check the developer's profile on the App Store for more information about them.

### Look for the App Reviews

 The second step you should take is to check the reviews of the app you want to download. To quickly spot a fake app on the App Store, you should always refer to the reviews section and see what other users think.

 If there is a series of negative reviews, it might be a sign that something is wrong with the app. It is also important to check if the reviews were done by real people or not, as fake reviews can be deceiving. This is [a tactic known as click farming](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-click-farm/).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Review App Permissions

 Another reliable way to spot a fake app on the App Store is by closely examining its permissions. If an app requests more than what is necessary, it could be a sign it is not legitimate.

 For instance, a simple calculator app asking permission for your contacts is obviously suspicious. Similarly, why might a ChatGPT app need access to your address book? Before you download it, check if the app actually requires access to your contacts, location data, or other sensitive data.

### Check the Logo and Grammatical Errors

 It is also important to check the logo, graphics, and description of the service, as fake apps often use outdated logos, poor quality graphics, and have grammatical errors in descriptions. If you notice any discrepancies in these areas, it is likely that you are dealing with a fraudulent version of ChatGPT.

### Examine the Number of Downloads

 You can also get an idea of the trustworthiness of an app by checking the number of downloads it has. Generally, apps with many downloads are more reliable as they have been verified and tested by other users. Fake chatbot apps typically have lower download numbers than legitimate ones, so this may be another indicator that you're dealing with something fraudulent.

### Verify App Versions and Authenticity

 Always ensure that the app you are downloading is the latest version and has been updated regularly by its developer. Fake apps often remain unchanged for a long time, which can be an indication that something is amiss.

 Lastly, if an app seems too good to be true, it probably is. Before downloading anything, especially apps related to chatbots and AI, you should double-check it for authenticity and security.

## Stay Safe From Fake ChatGPT Apps

 Fake ChatGPT apps can put your device's security at risk by downloading malicious code, tracking your browsing activity, and collecting private data. It is important to be aware of such fake apps on Apple's App Store as they may contain malware or spyware, which can cause damage to your device and even harm your privacy in the long run.

 Fortunately, taking a few precautions when downloading an app can help you avoid any potential risks associated with malicious apps.
