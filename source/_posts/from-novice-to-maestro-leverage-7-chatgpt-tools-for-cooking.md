## From Novice to Maestro: Leverage 7 ChatGPT Tools for Cooking

 While cooking your favorite dishes can be exciting, it can also sometimes be a daunting process. Finding new recipes, incorporating new techniques, and playing around with different flavors can be difficult if youâ€™re not confident with your cooking skills. But, what if an AI chatbot could help you along the way?

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 ChatGPT has excellent conversational skills and its versatility makes it a superb tool for various activities. It turns out that being a cooking assistant is one of them. From recommending and creating healthy meal plans to coming up with specific menus for special occasions, there are a lot of ways you can use ChatGPT's help while in the kitchen.

## 1\. Recipe Suggestions

 You don't have to rely on last night's leftovers or takeout for your daily meals. If you're having trouble deciding what to prepare for dinner, ChatGPT can give you a variety of suggestions for easy everyday recipes.

 This works especially well if you [get good at creating specific prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/). For instance, you can ask the chatbot to suggest high-protein or high-fiber recipes from a particular cuisine. Or if you have a health condition, ChatGPT can offer you healthier meal choices customized to your specific needs.

 What's better is that you can also ask the chatbot for alternative dishes that are easier to make if you don't have all the ingredients on hand.

## 2\. Learn New Cooking Techniques

 Even your favorite dishes can get a bit boring if you cook them the same way every time. You can use ChatGPT to come up with new cooking, baking, and grilling techniques to change up your dishes sporadically. For example, you can ask for different ways to grill meat or ways to season a salmon for maximum flavor.

 Granted, you could just Google this stuff. However, ChatGPT's conversational skills make the experience better. You could probe it for more specific details, get recommendations based on available ingredients, or find vegan alternatives to popular dishes.

 The chatbot can also recommend [the best meal prep sites](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/), cookbooks, or cooking classes focusing on the techniques you want to learn.

 If you are very conscious about the food you eat, ChatGPT can help you understand your dietary requirements. By analyzing this, the [AI chatbot can create healthy meal plans](https://www.makeuseof.com/create-healthy-meal-plan-using-chatgpt/) and recipes that align with your dietary preferences. This personalized approach ensures that you get the nutrients you need while still enjoying the foods you love.

 For your fitness goals, ChatGPT can assist you in creating a meal plan that supports your objectives. You can ask for meal recommendations that are rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. ChatGPT can also guide you on how to develop healthy eating habits if you have an eating disorder.

## 4\. Create a Shopping List

![Create shopping list with ChatGPT](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/create-shopping-list-with-chatgpt.jpg)

 If you struggle with remembering all the ingredients needed for a recipe, ChatGPT can help you create a detailed shopping list. [You can then use Instacart for same-day grocery shopping](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-how-is-instacart-for-same-day-grocery-shopping/), or any other grocery delivery services available in your area.

 This entire process is even better if you have a ChatGPT Plus subscription. [You can install and use plugins](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-install-and-use-chatgpt-plugins/) with the premium service to order ingredients within ChatGPT. For example, once ChatGPT generates a recipe for you, use the InstaCart plugin to order the ingredients and get them delivered to you on the same day.

 Even if you opt for writing the items down on a pad, the AI-powered chatbot can still make writing a shopping list much easier.

## 5\. Find New Flavor Combinations

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Finding new flavor combinations is arguably the most difficult process involved with cooking. Even if a certain combination is good, you won't really know if it works for you or not. ChatGPT can make this process a bit easier.

 Besides simply asking ChatGPT for flavor combinations with chicken, you can get specific and say you don't do well with spices. You can also ask for information on specific seasonings, herbs, or spices.

 It can also help you combine ingredients in innovative ways to create unique dishes. For example, you can ask the chatbot for flavor combinations that pair well with coconut milk, and it will then give you relevant recommendations along with some recipes.

## 6\. Recipe Scaling

 When you want to make more or less of a dish, you need to adjust the recipe by scaling it. This means adjusting the quantities of ingredients based on the desired number of servings. However, it can be difficult to get the measurements right, and mistakes can result in a disappointing meal.

 Fortunately, you can use ChatGPT to help you rescale the recipe accurately. Share the recipe with ChatGPT and it will calculate the right quantities of each ingredient needed for your desired serving size. This way you'll retain the delicious flavor while making sure that everyone gets an adequate portion size.

## 7\. Create a Menu for Special Occasions

![Special Occasian Recipe](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/special-ocassian-recipe.jpg)

 Creating menus for planning an intimate dinner party, a festive gathering, or a celebratory event is not easy. You have to consider what type of food the people will like and how much time you have to prepare the dishes. While you're on your own with the cooking process, ChatGPT can help you with the menu.

 So, if you're planning your kid's birthday party, you can ask ChatGPT to create a menu that includes fun and kid-friendly dishes. You can also specify dietary restrictions and allergies so that the food is safe and enjoyable for everyone.

 If you don't feel like cooking, you could just ask ChatGPT for the best restaurants or catering services to order from for the gathering.

## Level Up Your Cooking Skills With ChatGPT

 ChatGPT's versatility proves that it's much more than an AI text generator. It's an intelligent assistant that can help with research, coding, and even cooking. OpenAI continues to improve the chatbot by adding new features and regularly updating the interface. A year or two ago, using AI in the kitchen would have been a foreign concept, yet here we are.

 However, there's a lot more to cooking than recipes and meal plans. You'll have to spend a considerable amount in the kitchen if you want to cook healthy and delicious meals. Plus, more advanced techniques, such as sous vide, will require a lot of patience and the right accessories.
