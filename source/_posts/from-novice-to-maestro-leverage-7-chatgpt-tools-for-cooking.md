 This works especially well if you [get good at creating specific prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/). For instance, you can ask the chatbot to suggest high-protein or high-fiber recipes from a particular cuisine. Or if you have a health condition, ChatGPT can offer you healthier meal choices customized to your specific needs.

You can use ChatGPT to come up with new cooking, baking, and grilling techniques to change up your dishes sporadically. For example, you can ask for different ways to grill meat or ways to season a salmon for maximum flavor.

 Granted, you could just Google this stuff. However, ChatGPT's conversational skills make the experience better. You could probe it for more specific details, get recommendations based on available ingredients, or find vegan alternatives to popular dishes.

 The chatbot can also recommend [the best meal prep sites](https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/), cookbooks, or cooking classes focusing on the techniques you want to learn.

 If you struggle with remembering all the ingredients needed for a recipe, ChatGPT can help you create a detailed shopping list. [You can then use Instacart for same-day grocery shopping](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-how-is-instacart-for-same-day-grocery-shopping/), or any other grocery delivery services available in your area.

 Finding new flavor combinations is arguably the most difficult process involved with cooking. Even if a certain combination is good, you won't really know if it works for you or not. ChatGPT can make this process a bit easier.

 Besides simply asking ChatGPT for flavor combinations with chicken, you can get specific and say you don't do well with spices. You can also ask for information on specific seasonings, herbs, or spices.

 It can also help you combine ingredients in innovative ways to create unique dishes. For example, you can ask the chatbot for flavor combinations that pair well with coconut milk, and it will then give you relevant recommendations along with some recipes.

## 6\. Recipe Scaling

 When you want to make more or less of a dish, you need to adjust the recipe by scaling it. This means adjusting the quantities of ingredients based on the desired number of servings. However, it can be difficult to get the measurements right, and mistakes can result in a disappointing meal.

 Fortunately, you can use ChatGPT to help you rescale the recipe accurately. Share the recipe with ChatGPT and it will calculate the right quantities of each ingredient needed for your desired serving size. This way you'll retain the delicious flavor while making sure that everyone gets an adequate portion size.

## 7\. Create a Menu for Special Occasions

 Creating menus for planning an intimate dinner party, a festive gathering, or a celebratory event is not easy. You have to consider what type of food the people will like and how much time you have to prepare the dishes. While you're on your own with the cooking process, ChatGPT can help you with the menu.

 So, if you're planning your kid's birthday party, you can ask ChatGPT to create a menu that includes fun and kid-friendly dishes. You can also specify dietary restrictions and allergies so that the food is safe and enjoyable for everyone.

 If you don't feel like cooking, you could just ask ChatGPT for the best restaurants or catering services to order from for the gathering.

## Level Up Your Cooking Skills With ChatGPT

 ChatGPT's versatility proves that it's much more than an AI text generator. It's an intelligent assistant that can help with research, coding, and even cooking.
