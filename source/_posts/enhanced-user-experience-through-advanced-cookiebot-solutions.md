[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a global Digital Intelligence company, has been identified as a Leader in NelsonHall’s Process Discovery and Process Mining NEAT Evaluation 2021\. NelsonHall, a leading global analyst firm specializing in digital operations transformation, has created the NEAT assessment tool to enable strategic sourcing managers to assess the performance of vendors across a range of criteria and business situations and identify the best performing vendors with specific capability in process mining, desktop process discovery, and the ability to plan and accelerate process change.

“We are thrilled to be recognized again by NelsonHall in this year’s Process Discovery and Mining assessment. Today’s information systems generate an overwhelming amount of data from both digital and physical sources. But when it’s properly ingested, merged, and analyzed, this wealth of data can be used to discover patterns and insights that illuminate paths to better customer experiences and new operational efficiencies. With ABBYY Timeline, customers across many different industries can easily discover, understand, and manage business process execution more effectively.”

ABBYY is positioned in the top grouping in the comparative assessment due to its ability to deliver immediate benefits and meet future client requirements. The positioning was attained based on, among other factors: the maturity of its offerings, delivery capability, benefits achieved for clients, level of partnership with clients, mechanism to drive innovation, and the extent to which the company is positioned to support the customer journey throughout the life of the contract.

“ABBYY offers one of a handful of platforms with native process mining and task mining capabilities and amongst only a few where the two capabilities are well integrated. Clients get an accurate 360-degree view that will help them understand their business processes on multiple levels and plan change initiatives. The company’s investments in helping clients to accelerate change implementation coupled with its aforementioned capabilities are why it is positioned as a Leader.”
