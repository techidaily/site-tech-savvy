 Unlike ChatGPT, [Google Cloud Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) isn’t a chatbot itself; it’s a tool that allows you to build realistic conversations for your own chatbots.

 This is great for businesses that want to greet users and help them on their website, provide support for users, and even handle sales flows that would otherwise require a person to help. The main downside of Dialogflow is the learning curve.
