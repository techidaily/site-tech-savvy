 Before you delete your ChatGPT account, there are a few things you should do first.

### 1\. Export Your Data

 ChatGPT gives you the option to export your account data. This includes your profile information, conversations, and prompts.

### 2\. Save Your Favorite Prompts

 If you have any favorite ChatGPT prompts, save them before deleting your account. You can easily save these prompts by copying and pasting them into a document.
