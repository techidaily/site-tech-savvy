 Well, you can! Thanks to a handy add-in, you can seamlessly integrate the power of ChatGPT into Microsoft Word, making your document creation process more efficient and effective.

## How to Install the ChatGPT Add-In in Word

 Since [Microsoft Copilot is the official AI assistance for Microsoft Office](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-microsoft-365-copilot/), there has been little reason to integrate ChatGPT into Office apps like Word. Nevertheless, the [ChatGPT for Excel Word](https://pages.store.office.com/addinsinstallpage.aspx?assetid=WA200005502) add-in allows you to use your OpenAI API to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT right within your Word application.

 Here's how you can install this add-in to use ChatGPT inside Word:

1. Open Microsoft Word.
2. Navigate to the **Insert** tab from the ribbon.
3. Click on **Get Add-ins** to go to the Microsoft Office Add-ins store.  
![Microsoft Word add-ins store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/microsoft-word-add-ins-store.jpg)
4. Search for **ChatGPT**.
5. Find ChatGPT for Excel Word and click **Add** to install it.
6. Click **Continue** to accept the license and agreements.

 Once the add-in finishes installing, you'll get a prompt on the bottom right telling you you can access the add-in from the Home tab.

## How to Generate Documents in Word With ChatGPT

 After successfully installing the ChatGPT add-in, you need to provide it with your OpenAI API key for it to work. If you don't already have one, you can create an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.

 Once you get the answer to your prompt, the add-in provides you with the options to **Embed** the reply under the selection, or to **Replace** the selection with the ChatGPT reply.

 The add-in displays a preview of how many tokens your prompt will cost under the prompt box. ChatGPT uses the entire conversation as context, so remember to reset the conversation to avoid exceeding your [ChatGPT token limit](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/).
