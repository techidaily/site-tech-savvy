 Automation has become essential to increasing productivity and efficiency. Microsoft Word, the ubiquitous word processing software, has been a staple for document creation for decades. But what if you could enhance your document creation process with the power of artificial intelligence?

 Well, you can! Thanks to a handy add-in, you can seamlessly integrate the power of ChatGPT into Microsoft Word, making your document creation process more efficient and effective.

## How to Install the ChatGPT Add-In in Word

 Since [Microsoft Copilot is the official AI assistance for Microsoft Office](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-microsoft-365-copilot/), there has been little reason to integrate ChatGPT into Office apps like Word. Nevertheless, the [ChatGPT for Excel Word](https://pages.store.office.com/addinsinstallpage.aspx?assetid=WA200005502) add-in allows you to use your OpenAI API to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT right within your Word application.

 Here's how you can install this add-in to use ChatGPT inside Word:

1. Open Microsoft Word.
2. Navigate to the **Insert** tab from the ribbon.
3. Click on **Get Add-ins** to go to the Microsoft Office Add-ins store.

## How to Generate Documents in Word With ChatGPT

 After successfully installing the ChatGPT add-in, you need to provide it with your OpenAI API key for it to work. If you don't already have one, you can create an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.

 The best thing about this ChatGPT add-in is that it doesn't just save you a trip to your browser. It also works based on the context of your document, or selections of your document. With the add-in open, highlight a piece of your document, and you'll see that the prompt box in the add-in says it's using selection as context. You can also use the entire document as context by pressing **Ctrl** \+ **A** on your keyboard to select everything.

![Using the ChatGPT Add-in in Word](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/using-the-chatgpt-add-in-in-word.jpg)

 Now input a prompt and click **Send** to see the magic of AI at work. You can use ChatGPT to translate, summarize, and improve the text in your Word document. You can also ask it questions and get answers based on your selected context.

 In addition, you can select a piece of the text and ask ChatGPT to write the rest for you. For better output, you can [train ChatGPT to write like you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/) before asking it to generate text.

 Once you get the answer to your prompt, the add-in provides you with the options to **Embed** the reply under the selection, or to **Replace** the selection with the ChatGPT reply.

 The add-in displays a preview of how many tokens your prompt will cost under the prompt box.
