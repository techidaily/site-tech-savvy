## Unleashing Potential: Selective AI Apps for Writers

 Most content writers are discouraged from using artificial intelligence (AI) in their writing, but AI tools can still be helpful in a content writer's workflow. Whether they‚Äôre used for idea generation, transcribing ideas or meetings, proofreading, SEO research, or even as a bounce board, AI can be used without plagiarizing writing content.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Here are eight AI tools to help content writers with their writing workflow. Use them responsibly as an AI assistant and not a writing replacement.

## 1\. Otter AI

 Transcription services can speed up any writer‚Äôs workflow, especially if you ever find yourself staring at a blank page because you can‚Äôt get the words from your head onto the page or didn‚Äôt take comprehensive notes during your meetings. With Otter AI, it can transcribe for you.

 Otter AI uses real-time transcription technology to save you time taking notes. There‚Äôs also a built-in collaboration feature to give names to different voices if in a multi-person meeting. You can highlight, comment, or insert images directly to real-time transcribed conversations. Otter AI also highlights keywords, which can be helpful in your writing research.

**Download**: Otter AI for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otter-voice-meeting-notes/id1276437113) | [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2028506/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aisense.otter&pli=1) | [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/otterai-record-and-transc/bnmojkbbkkonlmlfgejehefjldooiedp) (Free, premium subscriptions available)

## 2\. ChatGPT

![ChatGPT generating an article outline.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chat-gpt-article-outline.jpg)

 ChatGPT has been one of the biggest successes of the AI generation. You can use this AI textbot as a tool for your writing, but it comes in handy as a fantastic idea generator.

 If you pride yourself as a content writer, you shouldn‚Äôt use ChatGPT to write your content, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be used in other ways. Content creators need a steady flow of new ideas, and sometimes your mind is blank.

 Ask ChatGPT for some writing ideas within your content niche, and then use your writing expertise to expand upon the results. You can also [train ChatGPT to write like you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/) to reflect your personal style.
