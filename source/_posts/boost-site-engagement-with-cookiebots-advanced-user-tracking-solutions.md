We are proud to share that our latest innovation, [ABBYY Vantage,](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) has been named one of [KMWorld’s 2021 Trend Setting Products](https://www.kmworld.com/Articles/Editorial/Features/KMWorld-Trend-Setting-Products-of-2021-148073.aspx)—a list curated by KMWorld that showcases advanced products and service—offerings that are designed to help organizations derive greater benefit from their information, share knowledge efficiently, make better decisions, enable compliance, effectively support employees, and communicate seamlessly with customers.

ABBYY Vantage is the first no-code, cloud-based platform that addresses organizations’ need to make quicker decisions while increasing productivity, accelerating their scale of innovation, and using technology in new ways—all with less time, talent shortages, and new remote working conditions.

### Looking for a smarter way to automate document processes?

There's a skill for that.

[Visit ABBYY Marketplace](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) 

Vantage was developed with a new kind of business worker in mind who is looking for a faster way to consume and leverage data contained within documents, with the notion that data is the fuel that powers businesses and serves customers. The new solutions are specifically dedicated to helping companies unlock the data within their documents and accelerate their business processes—empowering them to work smarter and deliver value to customers when it matters most.

[The easy-to-use, no-code Vantage platform can be utilized to set up and train Document, Classification, and Process skills for just about any document type and flow. Learn more!](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)

Supplementing Vantage is the ABBYY Marketplace, the first digital marketplace for processing and understanding enterprise documents that provides a rich collection of document skills, connectors, and assets. These enhance and extend the ABBYY Vantage platform and accelerate the digital transformation of organizations of any size, industry, and geography. “[Document Skills](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/),” as we call them, enable intelligent automation platforms, digital workers, and automation robots to intelligently process business documents in a human-like manner—to understand, extract meaning, and make decisions. Skills are a no-code design approach and allow citizen developers to utilize the power of Vantage cognitive services to design and train machine learning models for all types of documents–from invoices and purchase orders to bank statements and loan applications.

ABBYY Marketplace comes pre-loaded with skills covering a variety of use cases and industries, with both ABBYY developed skills and skills developed by our partners—hence our saying, “There’s a skill for that!” Imagine seeking to process business tax documents and seeing skills available from leading auditors and consultants that are experts in processing that content, ready for you to consume. More than 500 organizations have already provided overwhelming, positive feedback about our new way of document processing and over 100 successful trials have been started since general release on August 9th, attracting several businesses’ interest in the solutions, including four of the top U.S. banks and many cloud-based companies.

Additionally, we have connectors available for many systems and automation tools today, including ABBYY developed connectors for [Blue Prism](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [UiPath](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Alteryx](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Microsoft (Power Automate)](https://marketplace.abbyy.com/root/abbyy-vantage-connector-microsoft-power-automate/) and partner-built connectors for [Kryon](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Cherrywork®](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Pipefy,](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) [Cognigy](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), [Toca](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), and [Netcontent®.](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)Several other vendor connectors—including Automation Anywhere, PEGA and NICE—will be added over the next few months, as well. Why struggle with complex design and setup tools, scripting, training, business rules, and exception handling when ABBYY has built it for you already and delivered it to you as an easily consumable and deployable skill?
