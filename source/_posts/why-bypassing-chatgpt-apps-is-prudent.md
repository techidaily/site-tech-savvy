## Why Bypassing ChatGPT Apps Is Prudent

 The arrival of ChatGPT is one of the most disruptive events in the tech world in recent times. One moment, everyone is discussing the potentials of Web 3.0 and the metaverse. The next moment, we are all in awe of the powers of ChatGPT.

 Unfortunately, like with most new technology, a lot of fakes tend to pop up. Banking on the popularity of ChatGPT, many app developers are pushing fake ChatGPT apps on app stores. Here's why you should stay away from the bulk of ChatGPT apps you find on mobile app stores.

 Both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store have recently seen a significant surge in [AI chatbot apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-chatbot-therapist-mobile-apps-pocket/), most of which only appeared shortly after the launch of ChatGPT in the last quarter of 2022\. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem. Who doesn't love an AI chatbot?

 Unfortunately, a vast majority of these apps are misleading users by posing as official ChatGPT mobile apps. Some go as far as fleecing unsuspecting users by offering a premium version that claims to outdo [what your regular ChatGPT can do](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/). These claims are generally false.

 The only ChatGPT mobile app you should download is the official [iOS ChatGPT mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069) by OpenAI, which is currently available for download on the Apple Store. As of July 1st, 2023, OpenAI has only released an iOS mobile app so any Android app that claims to be from OpenAI is almost certainly fraudulent.

 We tried dozens of the so-called ChatGPT apps on the Play Store and App Store. For those that worked, none of them could offer anything significantly different from what the browser-based version of ChatGPT offers. A lot of them are apps with pre-written prompts, all of which you can write if you know [how to craft the right ChatGPT prompts](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/).

 Also, a common theme with these kinds of apps is that they're packed with ads. A bulk of them couldn't even get past the authentication screen but were quite keen on asking for credit card details.

 Although we tried a lot of these apps, there are still hundreds on both app stores we couldn't test. So, if you stumble on one that truly adds extra value, carefully weigh the cost of using your ChatGPT credentials on such apps. The [dark web is flooded with stolen ChatGPT accounts](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-hackers-target-chatgpt-accounts/), and using fraudulent apps is among the methods hackers are using to harvest ChatGPT accounts.

## Are There Legit ChatGPT Apps From Third-Party Developers?

 While OpenAI doesn't have an official ChatGPT app, it would still be technically possible for third-party developers to create apps using the same technology that runs ChatGPT.

 There are many legitimate mobile apps that use [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gpt-3-and-is-it-really-the-future-of-creative-work/) and GPT-4 APIs which makes it possible to answer questions and perform tasks akin to what ChatGPT would do. However, these apps differ from ChatGPT and are not as powerful or nearly as efficient as ChatGPT.

## Beware of Fake ChatGPT Apps

 Losing your ChatGPT account to fake apps might not seem like a big deal, but it could be. Sure, with a phone number and email, you could create a new account in minutes. However, the personal data you've shared in your ChatGPT account could be used to target you if it falls into the hands of malicious actors.

 It's best to avoid scenarios like this by being proactive with your safety. Be cautious of ChatGPT apps you find on app stores. The best way to access ChatGPT right now is through your browser on both PC and mobile or using the official iOS mobile app.
