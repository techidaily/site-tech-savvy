## How to Screenshot on Windows? Here’s the Quick Way

Want to show your Windows screen to your friends on chat windows like Slack? Want to share something fun on your Windows screen on Instagram or Twitter? Or want to capture your screen for error message to send to a technician…. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae002b4a8048.jpg)  Whatever the reason here’re quick ways to **screenshot on Windows** .

## Try these 3 quick ways to screenshot on Windows

1. [Screenshot your full screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Screenshot your single active window](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Screenshot any part of your screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Way 1: Screenshot your full screen

 If you want to screenshot your full screen, the most recommended way is to **press the PrtSc key**  on your keyboard. The PrtSc key allows you to **capture your full screen** on all versions of Windows.  1) Let your Windows display the screen you want to screenshot.  2) On your keyboard (usually on the first right line), press the **PrtSc** key. This key  may show as **Print Screen** , **PrtScn** , **PrtScr**  varying from different keyboards.

 Tada! Your Windows screen image should now be saved to the clipboard.

**NOTE:** If you use multiple monitors, when you press the PrtSc key, all your monitor screens would be captured simultaneously in one image.

 3) Now you can paste the picture on your chat windows or on **Paint** to save it by pressing the **Ctrl** and **V** keys at the same time.  If unluckily, your print screen key stops working, you can troubleshoot it using this easy guide — [Print Screen Not Working](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Pro tip

 If you’re using Windows 8 or Windows 10, and you want to save your Windows screenshot, you can do that much faster. **Here’s how:**  Let Windows shows the screen you want to save, then on your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5adee6ae232d5.png) and **PrtSc**  key at the same time. Your Windows screen will then be saved as an image automatically. You can find the image in the Screenshots folder of Pictures: ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/folder.png)

## Way 2: Screenshot your single active window

 If you just would like to screenshot your current active window instead of a full screen, it’s also easy to do:  Go to any window you want to print, then press **Alt** and **PrtSc**  at the same time on your keyboard. Now you have the screenshot of your active window on your clipboard. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Snap17.png)  Now you can paste the picture on your chat windows or on Paint to save it by pressing the **Ctrl** and **V** keys at the same time.

Then click **Snipping Tool** on the top. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/snipping-tool.png)  3) You should then see the small Snipping Tool window.

You can directly paste it on your chat windows or save it on Snipping tool via **File > Save as…**
