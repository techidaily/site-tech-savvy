Aside from the intuitive app design across different platforms, [CyberGhost](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-9041660-15735261?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) is a solid [VPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) that offers many features for secure online browsing. Top of the list is a large fleet of optimized servers for international streaming and military-grade data encryption for unbeatable protection, including on public Wi-Fi networks. 

CyberGhost's cheapest plan is the 2-year subscription, which is just $2.19/month, but its short-term plans are more expensive.

If you're unsure whether CyberGhost is the right choice, this review, based on [extensive real-world testing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/), has all the details you need to make a quick buying decision. I'll cover the streaming experience, speed performance, server network, security and privacy, usability, and more.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS CyberGhost CyberGhost is recommended for novice and basic VPN users looking for an easy-to-use VPN service.

## How large is the CyberGhost VPN server network?

**CyberGhost has over 11,500 servers distributed in 100 countries and 126 cities.** This global coverage is similar to other reputable services like [ExpressVPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/), [NordVPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordvpn-review/), and [Surfshark](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/). It gives you secure IP addresses worldwide for watching your favorite content and playing online games from anywhere.

Some of these are virtual server locations, meaning the server infrastructure is not physically located in the country for which it offers the IP address but is in a nearby country. This approach enables the VPN to offer IP addresses for countries that restrict VPN operations like Belarus, Russia, China, Iran, and more. The virtual servers are as reliable and secure as the physical servers.

The icing on the cake is CyberGhost's optimized servers for streaming, gaming, and torrenting. The non-exhaustive streaming server list includes services like Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube TV, Fox Sports, Comedy Central, and many more.

The gaming servers are optimized to keep latency low and minimize lagging, while P2P servers support secure and fast torrenting.

Additionally, CyberGhost offers dedicated IP addresses in 21 locations. You can get these if you don't prefer the shared IP addresses. The latter are sometimes blocklisted on IP-sensitive platforms for policy violations and also tend to trigger a lot of CAPTCHA verifications (I encountered this a few times on Google during my testing).

## What is the CyberGhost VPN performance like?

### Speed

**I give CyberGhost a slightly above-average rating on speeds** \-- it's not the fastest I've tested so far, and not the slowest either. 

Generally, your internet connection will be slower when using a VPN. This is due to factors including the encryption process, the distance your internet has to travel, and user traffic. However, you'll notice speed differences from one VPN to another depending on how well it's optimized for performance.

I connected to the WireGuard protocol when testing CyberGhost server speeds because it's a protocol known for speed.

Without the internet, my download speeds in Nairobi were 25.90Mbps. I connected to servers near my location and then moved further. Here is a summary of the results, including latency/ping (which can be important when gaming).

## CyberGhost speed tests

| VPN Server                  | Location Distance (KMs) | Download speed (Mbps) | Latency (ms) | Upload speed (Mbps) |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| No VPN                      | 0                       | 25.9                  | 16           | 33.77               |
| Kenya                       | 0                       | 23.61 (8% drop)       | 29           | 32.12 (5% drop)     |
| South Africa (Johannesburg) | 3,204                   | 22.98 (11% drop)      | 80           | 32.81 (3% drop)     |
| Egypt (Cairo)               | 3,300                   | 22.56 (12% drop)      | 76           | 32.60 (3% drop)     |
| New York                    | 11,751                  | 16.61 (35% drop)      | 211          | 30.96 (8% drop)     |
| Los Angeles                 | 15,375                  | 15.78 (39% drop)      | 234          | 31.22 (8% drop)     |
| London                      | 6,639                   | 19.25 (22% drop)      | 200          | 32.15 (5% drop)     |
| Paris                       | 6,208                   | 21.09 (18% drop)      | 177          | 32.44 (4% drop)     |
| India                       | 4,293                   | 20.40 (21% drop)      | 297          | 31.92 (5% drop)     |
| Australia (Melbourne)       | 11,544                  | 17.46 (32% drop)      | 345          | 31.16 (7% drop)     |
| Japan                       | 10,986                  | 14.99 (42% drop)      | 389          | 30.09 (11% drop)    |

**On very close-by servers (like Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt) CyberGhost did well**, maintaining a speed drop of less than 15%. The distant servers, however, recorded significant speed drops of up to 42%.

If you will use servers far away for 4K streaming or any high-bandwidth activity, be sure to account for the significant speed drops. Use a stronger internet connection that can maintain at least 25Mbps for UHD quality or 5Mbps for HD after adjusting for the VPN speed impact.

I also noted that it sometimes takes longer (up to 20 seconds) to establish connections or switch servers on CyberGhost. While it can be a minor issue to me, it surely won't be for someone short on patience.

**Also:** [**The best VPNs for streaming: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-vpn/)

### Streaming 

Both the optimized servers and regular servers are seamless for online streaming. **I didn't experience any issues with accessing or streaming content in Full HD.** 

To be clear, I don't encourage breaking any rules, for example, using VPNs to access geo-restricted content. I only tested CyberGhost's streaming capabilities with the services I could legally access and then sought the help of my colleagues in different countries to test the services available in their countries.

Here is a summary of the platforms that successfully worked with CyberGhost without blocking the VPN connection.

## Streaming platforms that work with CyberGhost

| Platform           | Library Accessed                            | Best streaming quality |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Netflix            | US, UK, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Spain    | 4K Ultra HD            |
| Amazon Prime Video | US, UK, Canada, Germany, Austria, Australia | 4K Ultra HD            |
| Hulu               | US                                          | Full HD                |
| DAZN               | US, UK, Spain, Canada, Germany              | Full HD                |
| BBC iPlayer        | UK                                          | HD                     |
| YouTube TV         | US                                          | 4K Ultra HD            |

| Sky Sports         | UK                                          | HD                     |
| ESPN+              | US                                          | 4K Ultra HD            |

### Gaming

CyberGhost is a VPN made with gamers in mind, offering specialized gaming servers in many locations. This lets you connect to servers near your gaming hosts and minimize lag. It's a good sign that upload speeds didn't drop as much as the downloads because high-speed gaming also requires fast upload speeds. 

The high latency on the distant servers, however, implies that CyberGhost might not be up to task for intensive gaming. Only use servers near your location when playing fast-paced games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and League of Legends. Pick a server with a latency of less than 150ms (the app shows ping data on each server) for a better gaming experience. That said, I didn't encounter any lag while playing Roblox via the US servers.

### Torrenting

Torrent-friendly features include a wide range of security and privacy tools (which I'll address next) and P2P-optimized servers, including in jurisdictions with tolerant file-sharing laws like Spain and Switzerland. This is not an encouragement to download torrents illegally, but only material available for the public to use for free. Copyright infringement is outright illegal, and we don't condone such.

Plus, CyberGhost doesn't limit bandwidth, meaning you can send and download as many large files as you like without reaching any caps. However, it doesn't support port forwarding, which can enhance transfer speeds on clients such as BitTorrent, Vuze, and uTorrent.

## Is CyberGhost secure?

#### Security

**CyberGhost uses the best data encryption currently available, AES 256-bit cipher.** This is effective against cyberattacks, preventing hackers from obtaining or reading any data transmitted between your device and online websites. The encryption also protects you on WiFi hotspots. Thanks to the Automatic Wi-Fi Protection feature, you can even set CyberGhost to detect unsafe networks and connect instantly.

It's also possible to customize connections by choosing from three reliable protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2/IPSec. WireGuard offers a good balance of speed and security, OpenVPN is more customizable, and IKEv2 works well on mobile devices. But leave it to **CyberGhost to automatically choose the best protocol** depending on the context.

More complementary security features are;

* **Automatic kill switch.** Cuts off access to the internet if your VPN connection drops, which can expose your identifiable data. It ensures you only access websites when the connection is secure.
* **Leak protection.** Safeguards your sensitive information like IP, DNS, and WebRTC requests from leaking online.
* **Split tunneling.** Gives you the flexibility to choose specific apps or websites that can connect to the VPN on your device and exclude others.
* **Smart rules.** Allows you to provide custom instructions on how and when you want CyberGhost to connect.
* **Content blocker.** It detects and blocks risky domains often used by advertisers to distribute ads, malware, and trackers.

#### Privacy

On the privacy end, **CyberGhost runs a no-logs policy, independently audited and verified** by [Deloitte Romania](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/privacyhub/privacy-audit-2024/) (where it's headquartered). This means the company has committed itself to preserving user privacy by not collecting, storing, or sharing users' data with third parties like marketers, for example.

However, when I read the privacy policy, I found it to be a bit vague. Some user data is actually collected and shared. Quoting directly, the policy states that: 

"_We may share Non-personal Data associated with the use of our Website and the Services with 3rd part suppliers for the purposes of optimization of our Website and Services as well customer analytics and fraud prevention_". 

While the data collected is anonymized and not directly linked to the user, the fact that they can collect and share it is a concern if you're strict about your privacy. 

Also, the parent company, Kape Technologies (previously Crossrider) has had [a negative privacy reputation](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-is-kape-technologies-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-parent-company-of-cyberghost-vpn/), and was linked to malware distribution. The events occurred several years ago and may not reflect the company's present activities, but it's still worth noting.

On a positive note, CyberGhost integrates some features to boost VPN. The entire server fleet is RAM-only. This means the VPN servers only use RAM storage (not hard disk) and all user data is wiped off clean during regular server reboots. Also, CyberGhost offers NoSpy servers (which will cost you a little more) with extra privacy and are closely monitored by the in-house team.

## How is the user experience?

#### Ease of use

Setting up CyberGhost is very straightforward because **it offers native apps on a wide range of platforms and devices**. All it takes is to register for a user account, download the app for your device (from the website or app store), connect to a server location, and you're good to go. If you're unsure which server to use, click the Best Server Location feature on the app, and the VPN automatically selects one for you.

#### Compatibility with devices

The range of devices that support direct app installation apps are;

* PCs (macOS, Windows, Linux)
* Smartphones (Android, iOS)
* Smart TVs (Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku)
* Browsers (extensions for Chrome, Firefox)
* Routers

**Smart DNS feature allows you to use CyberGhost on devices that do not support VPNs**, like Apple TV, Samsung TV, and gaming consoles. You simply need to configure the DNS settings on your favorite streaming or browsing device, and then you can conveniently access geo-restricted movies and apps. However, smart DNS doesn't encrypt your connections or offer the protection features of a VPN.

#### Customer support

**CyberGhost's support team is on standby 24/7**, just in case you run into any issues. You can chat directly with a representative or send an email and get assistance at any time of the day.

## How much does CyberGhost cost?

**The cheapest subscription is the 2-year plan which costs $2.19/month,** and you get 2 extra months for free. Short-term plans are more expensive, going as high as $12.99 for the 1-month plan and $6.99/month for 6 months. This pricing approach doesn't appeal to users who only need a VPN once in a while (like me). But keep in mind that these prices change frequently and might be different at the time you're reading this.

Screenshot by Kennedy Otieno/ZDNET

There are extra premium feature purchases you add to your plan, like a dedicated IP address ($2.50/month) and Windows Security Suite ($1/month).

Plus, CyberGhost's 45-day money-back guarantee (on all but the one-month plan) is slightly more generous than the 30-day guarantee on most services. The VPN also supports multiple payment options like credit cards, PayPal, and Bitcoin.

**CyberGhost offers a free trial, but only on specific devices.** You can test the PC app (Windows and MacOS) for 24 hours, 3 days on Android, and 7 days on iOS.

## Is CyberGhost better than the competition?

Perhaps a quick side-by-side comparison of CyberGhost with other VPN services can help you decide whether it's the right pick for you. The table below summarizes how VPNs compete with other top brands.

## CyberGhost vs. other top VPNs

## ZDNET's buying advice

**[CyberGhost](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-9041660-15735261?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) is recommended for novice and basic VPN users** looking for something less complicated. It has a user-friendly setup, plus more custom features to save you the hassle of finding reliable connections. Whether you want to safely access work or cafe Wi-Fi hotspots or to stream your favorite content online, it'll easily pass.

But if you don't have room to compromise on speed or privacy, CyberGhost might not be ideal. It sometimes experiences lag on servers, especially on distant connections. While this is normal with VPNs, the speed loss is relatively high on CyberGhost when compared to top-tier services like ExpressVPN.

## FAQs

### Is CyberGhost free?

**CyberGhost isn't free, but offers a free browser extension on Chrome.** This only encrypts your web traffic and doesn't offer the full benefits of the VPN service. You can only secure your WiFi connections and access the global servers and IP addresses through the paid CyberGhost app. To test CyberGhost for free, you can use the 1-day free trial (on Windows and Mac PCs) or the 3- and 7-day trials offered on Android and iOS, respectively. Alternatively, the VPN runs a 45-day money-back guarantee during which you can test the service and get a refund.

### Can CyberGhost be trusted?

CyberGhost can be trusted for online protection because it uses robust encryption (AES 256-bit) and also has several security features. Privacy concerns have been raised in the past about the parent company Kape technologies. Also, CyberGhost's no-logs policy allows the app to collect and anonymously share some information with third parties (a common practice for some VPNs). 

That said, no issues have emerged recently, signifying CyberGhost's involvement in any malpractices. You can use the app safely, or simply find a close alternative if you don't want to take any chances with your privacy.
