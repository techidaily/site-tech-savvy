 The add-in displays a preview of how many tokens your prompt will cost under the prompt box. ChatGPT uses the entire conversation as context, so remember to reset the conversation to avoid exceeding your [ChatGPT token limit](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/).
