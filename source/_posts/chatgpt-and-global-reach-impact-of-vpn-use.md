## ChatGPT and Global Reach: Impact of VPN Use?

 While ChatGPT is now a mainstream AI tool, it isn't welcome everywhere. This AI chatbot has been banned in a number of countries, meaning residents cannot access it and make use of its features. But with a VPN, using ChatGPT may not be such a challenge in such scenarios.

## ChatGPT and VPNs

![Chat GPT homepage on phone](https://thmb.techidaily.com/c64fedaf756cbcf9ac92722c1b2668052e1efc526bd85097cc0c097ddacbbc3a.jpg)

 It's easy to access ChatGPT with a VPN, just like you would any other website. Once the VPN is active, you'll just need to log into ChatGPT, and you're good to go.

 There are a few reasons why you might use ChatGPT with a VPN, including:

* **Geographical Bans:** Certain countries, [such as Italy](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-has-italy-banned-chatgpt/), China, and Afghanistan, have banned or restricted ChatGPT, cutting off access to residents.
* **School and College Restrictions:** Some schools and colleges have restricted ChatGPT access on campus, though it may still be useful for your research.
* **General Privacy:** Even if ChatGPT isn't off-limits for you, you may still want to use a VPN as a general privacy and security layer while online.

 So, how does the process of using ChatGPT with a VPN work?

 Accessing ChatGPT with a VPN is quick and simple and doesn't require much technical know-how. The general process is as follows:

1. Create an account with the VPN provider of your choice.
2. Download the VPN's desktop or smartphone app and sign in.
3. Choose which server location you'd like to connect to.
4. Turn on your VPN and head to the ChatGPT website.

 There's a chance that your access to ChatGPT may be denied even if you've got a VPN active. In this case, you'll likely see the page shown below.

 If ChatGPT has blocked your VPN, consider clearing your cookies and cache, changing server locations, or restarting your browser.

 Certain VPN providers have blocked ChatGPT access in the past. There's no definitive list of VPNs that don't work with ChatGPT, as some work for certain users and don't work for others. However, there is a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12bvety/did%5Fopenai%5Fjust%5Fstart%5Fblocking%5Fvpn%5Faccess%5Fbeen/) discussing which VPNs haven't been able to access ChatGPT if you'd like to learn more.

 If you're using a free VPN service to use ChatGPT, make sure you still have access to server locations in countries where there are no ChatGPT restrictions.
