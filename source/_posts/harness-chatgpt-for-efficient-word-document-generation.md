 The best thing about this ChatGPT add-in is that it doesn't just save you a trip to your browser. It also works based on the context of your document, or selections of your document. With the add-in open, highlight a piece of your document, and you'll see that the prompt box in the add-in says it's using selection as context. You can also use the entire document as context by pressing **Ctrl** \+ **A** on your keyboard to select everything.

 In addition, you can select a piece of the text and ask ChatGPT to write the rest for you. For better output, you can [train ChatGPT to write like you](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-train-chatgpt-to-write-like-you/) before asking it to generate text.

 Once you get the answer to your prompt, the add-in provides you with the options to **Embed** the reply under the selection, or to **Replace** the selection with the ChatGPT reply.

 The add-in displays a preview of how many tokens your prompt will cost under the prompt box. ChatGPT uses the entire conversation as context, so remember to reset the conversation to avoid exceeding your [ChatGPT token limit](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-token-limit-can-you-exceed-it/).
