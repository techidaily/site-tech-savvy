 Processing the data export can take some time, depending on how much data you have. Once your data is ready, a download link will be sent to your email address. The link to the data export download expires 24 hours after you receive it, so be sure to download it within that time frame.

* Your account information (e.g., username and email address)
* Prompts you've sent ChatGPT.
* Responses to your prompt.
