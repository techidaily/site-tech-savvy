## Artificial Intelligence: 6 Rise of Creative Tools

 ChatGPT is proving to have a variety of uses for many different professions. It can help answer questions, solve problems, and come up with ideas that someone would never have thought of themselves.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 In the content creation world, there is a constant need to be thinking of quirky titles and creating scripts and posts. What if a content creator used ChatGPT to help with the small workings, so they’ll have more time to envision the big picture?

 Below are some ways that ChatGPT can help content creators, along with a few factors that you should keep in mind.

## 1\. Generate Social Media Descriptions

 After you’ve done all the work for coming up with an idea and creating your video or post, writing up a description is usually the next course of action. However, it can be a chore to create something both inspirational and relative to the post.

![ChatGPT Social Media Desciption answer for mountain summit post](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-social-media-desciption.jpeg)

 That’s where ChatGPT can come to help. By simply telling it specifically what your post needs to be about, it can generate a compelling description that will complement your post. You may even get some complimentary hashtags as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Create Scripts for Your Next Video

 If you’re in the video-making business, whether it’s for YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram, it’s usually a good idea to create a script if there’s quite a bit of talking involved. ChatGPT can create a script for you based on what your video is about.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ChatGPT Script about dog with zoomies](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-script.jpeg)

 However, it is suggested that you look over the content that the AI developed for you before recording. You never know what ChatGPT might have you trying to say.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Make Titles for Posts and Videos

 The title is one of the most important features of a post or video because it helps to catch people’s attention. However, sometimes it can be difficult to create a catchy title on a whim that you’re confident using for your next post.

![ChatGPT Titles about cooking Ramen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-titles.jpeg)

 Using ChatGPT to create your titles will help alleviate the stress of having to come up with one on your own. All you need to do is let the AI know what your post or video is about, and it’ll produce a few catchy titles for you to choose from.

 Are those titles not working for you? Simply ask ChatGPT for more, and the technology will provide it.

## 4\. Generate Keywords, Tags, and Hashtags

 When using social media, you gain an audience because of the type of content you create. However, getting your content out into the platform is necessary to grow your audience. Using keywords, tags, and hashtags is one of the most useful ways to do just that.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ChatGPT Hashtags for a goat yoga instagram post](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-hashtags.jpeg)

 The hard part, though, is figuring out what words you need to use. You have the opportunity to tell ChatGPT what your post will be about, and it’ll be able to spit out plenty of keywords and tags to use to attract views.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Make Outlines and Guides

 Because social media tends to be more fast-paced to keep an audience’s attention, using an outline can help to keep your posts on track. ChatGPT has the ability to create outlines and guides for any social media post.

 Are you creating a YouTube video about how to chop down a tree? The AI will give you a step-by-step outline that will help you cover a variety of important segments needed for the video—some of which could have been accidentally overlooked without ChatGPT’s assistance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Come Up With Content Ideas

 Feeling stuck and don’t know what to create next? Ask ChatGPT to suggest some ideas to help get you inspired.

![ChatGPT Content Ideas for a mountain vacation](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-content-ideas.jpeg)

 You can use this time with ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and maybe even step outside your comfort zone to attract viewers. Some things you should include are [what your niche is](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-find-niche-as-content-creator/), who your audience is, and any information that you know is required for your next project.

## 7\. Write Up Bios

 You would think that writing about yourself would be easy, but it can be challenging for some people. Ultimately, it’s all about trying to sell yourself to a platform full of potential supporters.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ChatGPT Instagram bio for a lumberjack account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-bio.jpeg)

 You can ask ChatGPT to write up your bio for you. Of course, you’ll need to include information about yourself. Simply tell it you need a bio about you and your niche for whichever platform, and it’ll pop out a profile that will be sure to attract followers.

## 8\. Give Results for Facts or Other Research

 If you’re creating a post that requires a bit of research, instead of scanning through articles for tidbits of information, why not save time and ask ChatGPT? Though ChatGPT does not have direct access to the internet, it does know a plethora of information.

![ChatGPT Facts about the Colorado River](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-facts.jpeg)

 However, to stay on the side of caution, doing a quick search to make sure the information is correct is always a good habit to have.

## 9\. Edit and Proofread Your Work

[Can ChatGPT be used as a proofreader?](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-be-used-as-proofreader/) The short answer is yes.

 With that being said, there are limitations to what the AI can do in terms of proofreading and editing. The computer program suggests that you ask it to look over one thing at a time: spelling, grammar, punctuation, passive voice, etc.

![ChatGPT Proofread a paragraph about a husky mixed dog.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-proofread.jpeg)

 If you ask ChatGPT to look over everything at once, it may give you corrections that don’t exist.

## Things to Be Aware Of

 Like anything, it’s essential to be mindful of the technology that you are using. [When using ChatGPT, there are a few things that content creators should avoid](https://www.makeuseof.com/mistakes-to-avoid-using-chatgpt-content-creation/) and be cautious of.

### 1\. Potential Outdated Information

 ChatGPT is a computer program that is constantly being updated. However, that doesn’t mean that everything it produces is current information. For example, in May 2023, ChatGPT could only retrieve information from September 2021 and older.

![ChatGPT Inaccurate Info Disclaimer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chatgpt-inaccurate-info.jpeg)

 If you’re looking for current events or what is currently trending, you may be missing the mark.

### 2\. Look Over What ChatGPT Produces

 It’s always a good idea to look over the information that ChatGPT gives you. Sometimes, it can be inaccurate or simply not what you were looking for, especially if the information is behind the times.

### 3\. Becoming Too Reliable on the Technology

 In the world of content creation, it’s essential to grow—and not only in numbers. It’s important not to become dependable on ChatGPT, especially to the point where you can’t come up with your own ideas.

 On the other hand, ChatGPT is a viable asset. The best practice would be to learn how to work with AI instead of having it work for you. This way, you’ll learn as you go and become an even better content creator.

## Start Using ChatGPT to Assist With Your Content Needs

 There are many tools creators can use to help them achieve success in the world of content creation. And even with the possible inaccuracies, ChatGPT can still be an asset for you as well.

 Try using ChatGPT to help in all areas of your creative process, and you'll be sure to produce some engaging content that'll attract viewers.
