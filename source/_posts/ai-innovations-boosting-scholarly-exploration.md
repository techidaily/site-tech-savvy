 Luckily, AI-powered tools exist to help make our lives easier, including the advancement of academic research. Whether you need to cut down the time you spend on research or you’re simply looking for ways to cite more effectively, AI tools can be helpful in supporting your research processes.

 Here, we’ll take a look at four ways AI tools enhance your academic research.

## 1\. Research Assistant Tools

 Research assistant tools can help you complete certain research tasks more efficiently. One of the benefits of using [AI-powered research assistant tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/the-6-best-ai-tools-for-researchers-and-teachers/) is that they can assist in gathering relevant information from a large pool of data.

 Elicit is a tool that helps you with research procedures, such as brainstorming ideas, finding research papers, summarizing key takeaways, analyzing patterns, and more. With this tool, researchers can cut down the time it takes to manually find and go through information.

 Elicit also allows you to manage your papers by categorizing research papers, creating personalized libraries, and the ability to have alerts and save searches.

## 2\. Smart Citations

![Scite.ai's citation page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sciteai-cite-page.jpg)

 Scite.ai uses AI-powered technology to provide system called Smart Citations. The Smart Citations system uses language processing that helps analyze academic articles to classify how specific research has been cited. It also provides information on whether the evidence supports or goes against the claims.

 Using a smart citation tool like Scite.ai can save you the trouble of having to manually analyze and understand the purpose behind how a certain paper is cited. Researchers are also able to cut down the time and effort spent on finding connections between papers, understanding how some studies are received in the scientific and research community, as well as identifying the effectiveness of research over time.

 AI-powered research tools like Semantic Scholar make the research process much easier. Semantic Scholar uses AI algorithms to help you extract important information from research articles, as well as enabling you to understand the context of research papers.

 This tool also allows researchers to quickly look through papers with TL;DRs. TL;DR stands for **Too Long; Didn’t Read**. A TL;DR gives you short summaries of a research paper to help you get what you need to know regarding the objective and outcome of the research. Using Semantic Scholar also means you can avoid manually formatting citations, as it gives you the option to cite any paper.

 Just like Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar also makes use of AI to help you [research like a pro](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-scholar-search-tips/). With Google Scholar, researchers get to enjoy receiving relevant search results through AI algorithms. You can also use the automatic citation feature to avoid doing it yourself. But it’s still important to ensure that the citation format is accurate.

 ChatGPT can help researchers navigate easily through their research processes by answering queries. When you [use prompts in ChatGPT correctly](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-mistakes-to-avoid/), ChatGPT can lead you to sources related to your research topic. You can retrieve key information, article summaries, brainstorm ideas, or find connections between multiple research papers.

 ChatGPT is effective in aiding your research process and can help you cut down the time you spend on specific tasks, but it should not be used as a replacement for appropriate research methods.
