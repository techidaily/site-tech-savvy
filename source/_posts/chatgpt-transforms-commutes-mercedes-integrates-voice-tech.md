[Mercedes-Benz](https://media.mercedes-benz.com/article/323212b5-1b56-458a-9324-20b25cc176cb) confirmed that ChatGPT with voice control will be available to more than 900,000 of its cars running the MBUX digital cockpit and infotainment software. This AI-powered voice assistant will at first be limited to Mercedes-Benz drivers in the US who are willing to sign up for the three-month beta program. However, Mercedes-Benz says it will improve and roll out the service in other countries after the beta program concludes successfully.

 If you want to access the ChatGPT assistant in your car, you can prompt the MBUX Voice Assistant by saying “Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.” Alternatively, you can access ChatGPT using the Mercedes me app that connects to your car using your smartphone. The update will be performed over the air, so you won't have to visit a Mercedes dealer to have this feature enabled.

 The best part about how it was integrated is that drivers can have a natural-sounding conversation with [ChatGPT using voice control](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-control-chatgpt-with-voice/) without taking their hands off the wheel. This means you can [prompt ChatGPT to help you with a lot of things](https://www.makeuseof.com/write-effective-chatgpt-prompts-for-ai-answers/), like finding out what you should eat for dinner, the best places to visit when you're in an unfamiliar location, or even how to change a tire.

 Beyond that, you can use [ChatGPT plug-ins](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-chatgpt-plugins/) to order food, find the best ticket prices, write emails, or [send a messages on Slack](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-slack/).

## Other Automakers Could Follow Suit

 Mercedes-Benz is not the only automaker to consider integrating ChatGPT into its cars. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-explores-using-chatgpt-vehicles-2023-03-10/), General Motors is also looking at introducing a virtual assistant powered by ChatGPT. This could be part of its strategy after [ditching Android Auto and Apple CarPlay](https://www.makeuseof.com/gm-to-drop-android-auto-apple-carplay/).

 It's worth noting that even without ChatGPT voice assistant integrated into your car’s infotainment system, you can still talk to ChatGPT driving if you’re connected to Apple CarPlay and Siri. This would be a good way to mimic Mercedes' native integration of the chatbot if you own a vehicle from another brand.

## ChatGPT Could Redefine Virtual Assistants in Vehicles

 ChatGPT has a lot of potential if it's integrated into vehicles, considering that it’s way more intelligent than Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa as a virtual assistant. Mercedes-Benz introducing ChatGPT to its vehicles is a sign of things to come in the automotive industry that could redefine how we interact with virtual assistants in our cars.
