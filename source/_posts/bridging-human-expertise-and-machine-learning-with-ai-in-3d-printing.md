## Bridging Human Expertise & Machine Learning with AI in 3D Printing

 Having arrived on the scene in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot has taken the world by storm. This innovative AI tool seems to constantly push boundaries, with users finding new ways to leverage the power of ChatGPT every day.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 For makers and 3D printing enthusiasts, ChatGPT offers a wealth of tools that make it much easier to make your projects come together. But how can you use ChatGPT for 3D printing?

## Can ChatGPT Help With 3D Printing?

 Before starting using ChatGPT for 3D printing, it’s important to know that it has many limitations. While it can generate basic 3D models, this tool isn’t made to take on the role of a 3D designer, and this means that you may have to do some of the work for yourself.

 ChatGPT can make it much easier to create and manage files for 3D printing and save you a lot of time and effort. 3D modeling is a time-consuming process that often involves a lot of repetitive tasks, and this makes it well worth using AI tools to make it faster.

## Generate an STL File With ChatGPT

[STL is the most commonly used file format for 3D printing](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-an-stl-file-what-is-it-used-for/). An STL file stores sets of instructions that enable CAD and slicer software to build a 3D model that was saved elsewhere or made at a different time. Thanks to their simplicity, ChatGPT can generate simple STL files for you.

 Let’s start with a simple 3D model and ask ChatGPT to generate a cube in the STL format. It’s important to be specific with your request to ensure that ChatGPT understands what you’re asking for. In this case, it’s worth specifying that you want your STL file in ASCII format to make it easier to read.

 You will need to head to the [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) website, create an account, and open the chatbot to get started.

 Provide ChatGPT with the request “Generate a 3D model of a cube using ASCII STL format” and wait for it to provide a response. You should see a small piece of code and a brief explanation of how it works below.

![ChatGPT generating a cube STL file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chatgpt-generate-cube-stl.jpg)

 Copy the text from the window and paste it into a blank notepad file. When you save the file, make sure that you change the extension to “.stl”. Now you can load the file into your slicer software of choice and prepare it for 3D printing.

 Note that on the first attempt, you may not always get the 3D model you asked for, in which case you’ll need to ask ChatGPT to correct it.

 While ChatGPT certainly has the ability to create STL files of greater complexity, OpenAI can’t dedicate the resources required for this sort of operation to free users. This is still an excellent tool for those who would like to build an understanding of how STL files work, though.

## Generate 3D Model Scripts for CAD Software With ChatGPT

 Many 3D modeling tools have the ability to generate 3D models using scripts. This isn’t always the most effective way to make 3D models when you have to write the script yourself, but ChatGPT can generate the script for you.

 Depending on the 3D modeling software you use, you will need to do some research to determine the programming language that it employs. Python scripting is available in Blender, but ChatGPT can work with a variety of languages.

 Start with “Generate a Python script for Blender to create a cube 3D model” as your request to ChatGPT. It may take some time for the chatbot to write your script, but it shouldn’t have any problem doing this with simple 3D models.

![ChatGPT generated Blender Python script](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chatgpt-cube-python.jpg)

 Once you have your script copied, you can load up Blender and head to the Scripting workspace. By default, you should see a script console on the left of the screen. Paste the ChatGPT-generated script into the console pane and hit the **Enter** key to see your 3D model appear in the 3D workspace.

 Like when generating an STL file with ChatGPT, there are limitations in place that mean that the chatbot won’t try to create scripts that are too time-consuming. Thankfully, though, you can find paid services around the web that expand ChatGPT’s script-writing abilities. You can [learn how to access GPT-4](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt4/) to enhance your 3D printing even further.

## How Else Can ChatGPT Help With 3D Printing?

 As you can see, ChatGPT has a lot of potential for 3D printing enthusiasts, but it doesn’t stop with generating scripts and STL files. OpenAI’s chatbot can offer support and advice with a variety of 3D printing questions.

* **G-Code File Repair**: [G-code files](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-g-code-file-how-can-you-prepare-one/) are commonly used by 3D printers to store instructions to carry out during a 3D print. When a G-code file gets corrupted or has an error, your 3D printer may refuse to print it or fail to print it properly. You can ask ChatGPT to analyze your G-code files and offer tips to help you repair them.
* **3D Model Prompts**: You can ask ChatGPT to provide 3D modeling prompts. Prompts like this make it easier to tackle complex 3D modeling tasks, while also enabling you to get third-party tools involved.
* **Third-Party Add-Ons**: Most 3D modeling applications have add-ons available that enable you to use ChatGPT to help with your 3D design. Some of these tools use the prompts generated by ChatGPT to make 3D models, while others rely on auto-generated scripts to work.
* **3D Printer Settings**: [Choosing the correct settings for the material you are 3D printing with](https://www.makeuseof.com/fdm-3d-printer-settings-and-what-they-do/) is a challenge, especially when you encounter defects and issues with your prints. You can use ChatGPT to troubleshoot your 3D printer settings and help you choose the best ones for your prints.

## Getting the Most Out of ChatGPT for 3D Printing

 It’s important to remember that the full scope of ChatGPT is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, you can experiment when you ask this chatbot for help with 3D printing, whether to generate STL files or 3D model scripts, or to check and repair G-code files. It’s worth taking the time to refine the questions you ask to get the best results.
