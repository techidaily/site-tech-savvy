**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 The rise of generative AI tools has taught us one thing: the results you get from AI tools are only as good as the prompt you provide. However, crafting AI prompts that produce awesome results requires creativity, time, and technical know-how.

 That's why AI prompt marketplaces have sprung up, offering unique AI prompts crafted by experts, selling you their AI wisdom. So, is it worth buying an AI prompt?

## What Are AI Prompt Marketplaces?

![screenshot of promptbase website homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/prompt-base-1.jpg)

 AI prompt marketplaces are platforms where people buy and sell prompts for generative AI tools. Most AI prompt marketplaces list an enormous range of pre-written prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Leonardo AI. Whether you're looking to create images, code, text, or anything in between, you can find ready-to-use prompts. You can think of it as a quick fix for your prompting problems whenever you're facing challenges with creativity or need ideas to spark your inspiration.

 Admittedly, a few Google searches will turn up dozens of prompt ideas from across the web, so the idea of paying for AI prompts might sound a bit odd. Why pay for something you could get for free from a Reddit post or the thousands of other websites on the internet?

## Why Buy An AI Prompt?

 AI prompts aren't particularly expensive. Even the top-performing AI prompts will only set you back a few dollars, so for most folks, the cost isn't the issue with buying an AI prompt. The real question comes down to output and quality, which are just some of the reasons you might consider buying a unique AI prompt.

### 1\. Lack of Prompting Expertise

 If you struggle to write effective AI prompts, it can be frustrating and feel like you're just spinning your wheels. No matter how many online guides you read or how much you experiment with phrasing, you don't seem to be making progress. In this case, buying a pre-made prompt can be a pragmatic solution. The prompt creators have already put in the hard work of optimizing word choices, structuring, and testing that you're finding difficult. Their expertise saves you time and guesswork.

### 2\. Quality and Consistency

 AI prompt marketplaces feature prompts created by professionals who, unlike most who use AI tools, create AI prompts professionally—not just as a hobby but as a job. They spend time iterating, refining, and testing their prompts to ensure they're of the highest quality and can consistently deliver the results they promise (consistency is a key part of why you might pay!).

### 3\. Specific Results

 One advantage of buying prompts from AI marketplaces is their narrow focus on specific use cases. These pre-crafted prompts target precise tasks that can be frustratingly difficult to accomplish independently. However, it's highly likely an AI prompt engineer has spent time crafting the perfect AI prompt for your problem.

## Do AI Marketplace Prompts Really Work?

 We've seen the value AI marketplaces are supposed to create, but do AI marketplace prompts work as advertised? We gave it a try with a real-life problem.

 I wanted to [create an image using DALL-E](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-dall-e-2/) with a floral theme and the inscription "Creating With AI." Despite being quite experienced with AI image prompting, this was still challenging. There are several AI prompt marketplaces to choose from, but we decided to use PromptBase for this demonstration. PromptBase is one of the leading AI prompt marketplaces, with a diverse catalog of AI prompts.

 To solve our problem, we searched for a prompt to help us use custom texts on DALL-E, and we found this prompt that promises [Photorealistic Images With Text Signs](https://promptbase.com/prompt/photorealistic-images-with-text-signs).

![screenshot from the promptbase website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-from-the-promptbase-website.jpg)

 We grabbed the prompt file, and with a few tweaks and a few dollars, the results were ready.

![creating with ai result from premium ai prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/creating-with-ai-result-from-premium-ai-prompt.jpg)

 Note that in the above AI image, the roses aren't the tricky bit. Many [AI text-to-image tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-text-to-art-generators/) specifically struggle with generating clear and accurate text, so having such an easy-to-read text is excellent. On top of it all, I can reuse the prompt repeatedly, any time I want.

 Apart from problems with adding inscriptions to images, you'll find prompts on PromptBase (and [other AI prompt marketplaces](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-ai-prompt-marketplaces/) like PromptHero, PromptSea, ChatX, etc) that help you bypass the ever-growing list of restrictions on generative AI tools.

 Maybe you need ChatGPT to write a specific code, and it refuses because it thinks you're trying to create malware. Or maybe you are trying to create content on a polarizing or controversial topic, and it refuses to help because it thinks you're trying to misuse the tool. AI prompt marketplaces have prompt tricks to help you out and only cost a couple of dollars to gain access, helping you skip the hours of trial and error and find the solution to your AI prompt problems.
