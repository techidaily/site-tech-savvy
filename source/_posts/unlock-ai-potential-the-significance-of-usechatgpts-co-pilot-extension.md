## Unlock AI Potential: The Significance of UseChatGPT's Co-Pilot Extension

 Copiloting is one of the most popular applications of AI currently following the demand for tools that can significantly improve our productivity. Courtesy of that, many tools have entered the market lately intending to serve this need.

**MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 UseChatGPT, like other AI-powered tools, is supposed to help you harness the power of large language models to improve your productivity. But, what unique features does it have, or is it just another tool ready to add bloat to our Chrome browsers? Let's find out.

## What Is UseChatGPT?

 UseChatGPT is a free Google Chrome extension that harnesses the capabilities of ChatGPT, Bard, Bing Chat, and Claude to enhance online productivity. It enables you to do simple repetitive tasks on any website, including writing, rewriting, summarizing, translating, explaining, and responding using AI.

 As a result, you improve the speed and efficiency of your work without necessarily logging into, using, and copy-pasting text from the AI tools. All you need is to enable the extension, and a Notion-like digital terminal will appear on any text area you use.

 UseChatGPT is free at the moment, making it a great addition to other [free AI prompt extensions](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-chrome-extensions-better-ai-prompts-answers-in-browsers/) and a cheaper alternative to premium copilots such as Microsoft Copilot and Copilotly. Notably, it already has over 400,000 users, which is a cause for consideration.

## How to Install and Start Using UseChatGPT

 To install and start using UseChatGPT, follow the steps below.

1. Visit the [UseChatGPT website](http://usechatgpt.ai) or search for the tool on Google Chrome extension and click on **Add to Chrome.**

## Benefits and Concerns of Using UseChatGPT

 There are several advantages that come with using UseChatGPT:

1. It allows you to use AI features without leaving your tab. The most important prompts are already provided, and all you have to do is to provide context for the prompt or content that needs to be worked on.
2. The tool is free to use. It has an in-built AI plugin (Free AI) which can be used independently of more established tools like [ChatGPT and Bard](https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-vs-google-bard/). Also, if you have accounts in the more popular AI tools, the tool uses an API to give you instant access.
3. The tool's providers have also curated a list of [over 150 optimized prompts](https://www.usechatgpt.ai/prompts) you can access from their website and use to improve your productivity in a wide range of activities. Whether you want to write a more optimized article than an existing one or write a YouTube video script, the prompts can give you a good head start.

 While UseChatGPT seems to tick all the right boxes, it's far from perfect.

1. The Free AI feature has a daily limit after exhausting your one week of free use. Inviting friends can get up to 24 weeks of Free AI without a daily limitation. Meanwhile, if you use the other AI providers, your usage limit depends on your account limit.
2. It's currently only available on Chrome. You cannot use this tool with other browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Meanwhile, its competitors, such as [Copilotly](https://www.copilotly.com), are available for more browsers.
3. It doesn't keep a record of sessions. Unlike ChatGPT, which saves your work in chat sequences you can access later, UseChatGPT deletes your history once you close your browser.

 Overall, UseChatGPT is a resourceful copilot that can significantly improve your productivity at no extra cost. Considering its early stage in the development cycle, it's likely to get way better with time.

## Should You Use the UseChatGPT Extension?

 UseChatGPT is just one of the many AI tools coming up today, courtesy of the AI race. It has a simple yet functional design that can significantly improve your ability to utilize AI technology and consequently be more productive. If you want to improve your productivity, this tool is worth a try, especially considering it's free to use.

 Meanwhile, there are many other alternative tools in the market you can consider, such as Microsoft's Copilot. However, it's important to keep in mind that these tools are only as good as your understanding of their functionalities.
