 Now that you've obtained your API key, it's time to put it to use in the Shortcuts app. Make sure you don't copy anything else to the clipboard during this process. And if you're wondering, here are some other [things you can do with the OpenAI API key](http://www.makeuseof.com/openai-api-guide-what-can-you-do/).

2. Tap **Add Shortcut**, and it will appear on the Shortcuts page.
3. Now, long-press on the shortcut you installed and choose **Edit** from the context menu.
4. Under the **Text** section, you'll see a prompt to add your API key. Paste your API key here after you delete the text for the prompt.
5. Tap **Done** in the top right corner.

## Using the ChatGPT Shortcut With Siri on Your iPhone

 Before we can use Siri to launch the ChatGPT shortcut, we need to ensure the shortcut has permission to function correctly. Tap on your shortcut, and you will be prompted to allow the shortcut to connect to OpenAI. Press **Allow** to give it the necessary permissions. If any of the shortcuts give you additional prompts, like asking you to allow access to **Speech Recognition** or **Enable Diction**, make sure you tap **Allow**.

 Once this is done, you are free to use your shortcuts with Siri, and it's just as easy as giving Siri any other command. All you have to do is say, "Hey Siri, launch SiriGPT" or "Hey Siri, launch ChatGPT 1.2.4," depending on what shortcut you've downloaded, and the chatbot will instantly be at your service. However, if Siri doesn't respond, you can [try these fixes if Hey Siri isn't working on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/hey-siri-not-working-iphone-how-to-fix/).
