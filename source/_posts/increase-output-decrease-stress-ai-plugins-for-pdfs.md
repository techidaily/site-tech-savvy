## Increase Output, Decrease Stress: AI Plugins for PDFs

 Often, we interact with PDFs, relying on their convenience of access. PDFs simplify our interaction with information, from reading novels and e-books to studying and analyzing graphs. But sometimes, it can be hard to work with them.

**SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 For instance, a PDF can contain hundreds of pages of a scanned physical book, making it difficult to interact with the text. These and many other challenges can be frustrating. Luckily, several AI-powered plugins are available on ChatGPT to save you the hustle.

## 1\. Ai PDF

 Ai PDF is a ChatGPT Plugin designed to streamline the extraction of information from PDF documents with fact-checking capabilities, helping you go through large documents quickly.

 To use it, copy the URL of your document and paste it into ChatGPT with the plugin enabled. You can then instruct it to provide any information you need. You can also generate a summary highlighting the main points of the entire document.

 The chat above shows the plugin extracting statistics from a 2022 IBM PDF report on the cost of [data breaches](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-data-breach-definition/).

## 2\. MixerBox ChatPDF

[MixerBox ChatPDF](https://www.mixerbox.com/chatgpt-plugins/chatpdf) is another powerful plugin that enables you to interact with documents in numerous ways, including summarizing information, translating text, and extracting deep insights.

 You just need to find the web address of a PDF document and paste it into ChatGPT. The document will undergo processing, and the plugin will provide a unique document ID representing the uploaded file. You can then ask any questions involving the document.

 Above is an illustration of the plugin summarizing a document into five main points and converting the text from English to Spanish.

## 3\. AAASummarize

[AAA Summarize](https://summarizeanything.ai/) is more than just a PDF document interaction tool. It can also be used to summarize web pages and even YouTube videos, giving you a quick overview of the content, so you can skip reading or watching.

 Once you paste a video's URL it reads the transcript and lets you retrieve insights. You can also summarize information on a specific PDF page or ask the tool to take you to a specific part of a video.
