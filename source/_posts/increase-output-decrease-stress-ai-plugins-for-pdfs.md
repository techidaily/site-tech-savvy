## Increase Output, Decrease Stress: AI Plugins for PDFs

 Often, we interact with PDFs, relying on their convenience of access. PDFs simplify our interaction with information, from reading novels and e-books to studying and analyzing graphs. But sometimes, it can be hard to work with them.

 For instance, a PDF can contain hundreds of pages of a scanned physical book, making it difficult to interact with the text. These and many other challenges can be frustrating. Luckily, several AI-powered plugins are available on ChatGPT to save you the hustle.
